Planetwise Flannel Wipes,"These flannel wipes are OK, but in my opinion not worth keeping.  I also ordered someImse Vimse Cloth Wipes-Ocean Blue-12 countwhich are larger, had a nicer, softer texture and just seemed higher quality.  I use cloth wipes for hands and faces and have been usingThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boyfor about 8 months now and need to replace them because they are starting to get rough and have had stink issues for a while that stripping no longer handles.",3
Planetwise Wipe Pouch,it came early and was not disappointed. i love planet wise bags and now my wipe holder. it keps my osocozy wipes moist and does not leak. highly recommend it.,5
Annas Dream Full Quilt with 2 Shams,Very soft and comfortable and warmer than it looks...fit the full size bed perfectly...would recommend to anyone looking for this type of quilt,5
Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love\'s Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"This is a product well worth the purchase.  I have not found anything else like this, and it is a positive, ingenious approach to losing the binky.  What I love most about this product is how much ownership my daughter has in getting rid of the binky.  She is so proud of herself, and loves her little fairy.  I love the artwork, the chart in the back, and the clever approach of this tool.",5
Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love\'s Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"All of my kids have cried non-stop when I tried to ween them off their pacifier, until I found Thumbuddy To Love\'s Binky Fairy Puppet.  It is an easy way to work with your kids to allow them to understand where their pacifier is going and help them part from it.This is a must buy book, and a great gift for expecting parents!!  You will save them soo many headaches.Thanks for this book!  You all rock!!",5
Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love\'s Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"When the Binky Fairy came to our house, we didn\'t have any special gift and book to help explain to her about how important it is to stop using a pacifier. This book does a great job to help prepare your child for the loss of their favorite item. The doll is adorable and we made lots of cute movies with the Binky Fairy telling our daughter about what happens when the Binky Fairy comes. I would highly recommend this product for any parent trying to break the pacifier or thumb sucking habit.",5
A Tale of Baby\'s Days with Peter Rabbit,"Lovely book, it\'s bound tightly so you may not be able to add alot of photos/cards aside from the designated spaces in the book. Shop around before you purchase, as it is currently listed at Barnes & Noble for 29.95!",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby\'s feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!",5
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","A friend of mine pinned this product on Pinterest so I decided to give it a whirl! It is fantastic! If you are a new parent, this will help you keep track of feedings, diaper changes and the like!",5
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log",This has been an easy way for my nanny to record all the key events that happen with my baby when I\'m not at home.  Would highly recommend it to someone who wants to stay informed of what your baby is up to while you\'re not home.The only reason this isn\'t a 5 is because I think there could have been some more standarad pre-printed options.I plan on ordering another one when we run out of pages in this journal.,4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I love this journal and our nanny uses it everyday to track on our daughter\'s sleep, eating and other activities. The layout and design make it very easy to fill in quickly with a comments column to add in details (i.e. we ask the nanny to specify what food she had for lunch, amount of milk she took, specifics of play time--tummy time, walk to park, etc.) I love knowing the details of my baby\'s day, and I also use it to track weekly on overall schedule patterns and changes (i.e. baby\'s nap time has moved naturally as she gets older).My only complaint is that there is no real space to communicate back to the nanny, as I sometimes want to reply to the nanny\'s comments and/or leave her notes about the previous night (i.e. Baby didn\'t sleep well or baby has rash, etc) or other instructions (Please use sun screen on the baby - it\'s hot out today) that I often forget to tell her in the rush of the morning. I just stick in post-its now for my notes. All in all, I highly recommend this baby tracker.",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","This book is perfect!  I\'m a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it\'s small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.",5
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one. She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind - I was getting incomplete/inaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember naps/feedings/diaper changes. I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information. This was the perfect solution! Now I\'m getting all the information I wanted. There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out. It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info. Each page goes from 7 - 6. This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm. I use an app on my phone for tracking when I\'m with the baby. I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone. My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it\'s a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided. Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format. This isn\'t a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal. 7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation.",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice.  But I haven\'t used this thing at all, and here\'s why:1.) When you\'re breastfeeding, it\'s often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don\'t nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You\'re also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I\'d forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I\'m not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction).",3
Nature\'s Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"Space for monthly photos, info and a lot of useful stickers come with it. It is exactly what I wanted!!",5
Nature\'s Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"I bought this calender for myself for my second son. It is very colorful and has room on each page to write height, weight, and what baby likes to do. There is also room on each page for a photo to be placed. The calender date boxes have room for a sticker and some fine writing. My only complaint is that it does not have as many stickers as I would like, but I just put asterisks before whatever special event happened that day. I bought one for a friend as she found it very useful as well.",4
Nature\'s Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"I love this little calender, you can keep track of all of baby\'s firsts. I like the illustrations, and the stickers too.",5
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,This was the only calender I could find for the second year. I did one for the first and wanted to continue cause there are so many things to note still after they turn 1. This one was better than the first year one I got him.,5
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,I completed a calendar for my son\'s first year and really enjoyed tracking all of his milestones and special moments - so much so that I wanted to continue in the second year since he\'s still doing amazing and fun things every day.  I really like the simple layout of the calendar and while it might not have all the questions and milestone stickers you want - at least it\'s something to keep recording all those special moments!,4
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,We wanted to get something to keep track of our child\'s milestones and this is a cute option. There aren\'t many other choices out there and this does exactly what we wanted.,5
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"I had a hard time finding a second year calendar, this is the only one I came across and it is great!  Large enough to write in the squares and has a spot to put that month\'s picture in as well as some memories. The first two years they change so much I like to jot everything down so I can keep track of all the big milestones...and little ones!  I find it is easier to do this on a calendar vs a baby book.  This way you can fill out the baby book later and have a great reference to do so!",5
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"I only purchased a second-year calendar for my son because I had one for my daughter. I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for second-year calendars in general, so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones. It\'s an okay calendar. The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens. The stickers aren\'t very cute and the pages are pretty old-fashioned looking. Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers.",2
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,I LOVE this calendar for recording events of my son\'s second year of life.  There are plenty of 1st year baby calendars out there and I loved reocording events of his first year and didn\'t want to just stop now that he is one.  Nature\'s lullabies second year calendar is perfect for continuing on with daily record keeping.  The stickers are wonderful and helped me think of milestones to record that I might not have thought of on my own.  I highly recommend this calendar!  Plus it\'s super cute and brat for either gender.,5
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"Calendar is exactly as described, but I find the look of it to be very cheap.  There are lots of nice stickers to use.  I was just disappointed it looks so cheap.",3
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"Wife loves this calender. Comes with a lot of stickers and options to mark the firsts. Includes spaces for milestone photos as well. Sticker borders for photos, etc, it is just a very easy to use scrap booking option. Especially for new moms who dont have enough time to actually sit down, and haul out a ton of scrapbook supplies",5
Nature\'s Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,My daughter had her 1st baby over a year ago. She did receive and fill up a First Year Calendar. When her son was nearing his first birthday she was looking for a Second Year Calendar to record his milestones. Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this for her and she LOVES it. Tender sweet art work - helpful stickers - unique pages to fill. A nice keepsake. A wonderful gift for a one-year old!,5
Baby\'s First Journal - Green,"Extremely useful! As a new mom, tired and inexpedient, not remembering how long ago baby ate, this definitely helped me through the first two months.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",My son loves peek a boo at this age of 9 months so I thought this book would be perfect! This book doesn\'t engage him enough though it seems.  He does however like the cover the most if I make pretend blow-kisses and peekaboo gestures with the hands and show him. He also likes when I fan the hair towards his face.Maybe when he\'s older he will flip the flaps but right now he just likes the mirror at the end and the front cover. If I flip the book through he just takes the book and shakes it around.,3
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","One of baby\'s first and favorite books, and it is washable! I gave 1 less star than perfect because I\'d like to see some diversity in the people - not just your typical white family ;)",4
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",I like how the book has a hook to attach it to your stroller or car seat - it wont get lost.  Great way to go over family members.,5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",Beautiful little book.  A great little short story saying I Love You....Keeps the attention of the baby and then the baby can actually turn the pages and hold on to it when you are finished interacting with it.,5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",This book is so worth the money. It says 9+ months on the box but I can\'t wait for my baby to be born to try to use it before. It\'s so cute and very interactive! There are flaps to open on every page.,5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","we just got this book for our one-year-old and she loves it.  It\'s so nice that she can\'t bite chunks out of it like she can a board book or rip it like a paper one.  She can chew on it, pull on it, and carry it all over the house!  She loves the little flaps that open and is learning simple words like ""daddy,"" ""mommy,"" ""puppy,"" etc.  We love it.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",The book is colorful and is perfect for 6months and older. The only thing I didn\'t like was the strong smell of the dyes and/or material. I dunked the pages in detergent. Then let the book dry overnight.,4
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","The book is cute, and we are huge fans of Lamaze products, however, this one leaves out some family members (no little brother) and can possibly cause hurt feelings. That said, our baby loves to play with the hands, hair and flaps!",3
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",What a great book for babies!  I\'d been looking for books which couldn\'t be damaged by my 10-month old\'s drool...so cloth or plastic books were my options.  This book adds another level to your usual cloth book--a fun flap or moving part on every page.  This interactive book is perfect for my baby!,5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","My son loved this book as an infant.  It was perfect because he would chew on his board books and destroy them, but this one we didn\'t have that issue.  I love the Lamaze series, they are a lot of fun not only for the child but for the parent.I liked that this book was not only teaching my son about Peek a Boo, but we used it to learn names for family members like grandparents, sister, cat, dog etc.  And of course with it being a lift the flap book, that was additional fun for my son as well.  He\'s nearly two now and he doesn\'t look at it as much, but he still does enjoy reading it and playing with it now and again.  I\'d say out of all the Lamaze books, this one and Discovery Farm are his favorites.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","Our baby loves this book & has loved it for a while now ... He enjoys when I read it to him, and enjoys playing with it on his own.",5
SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book,,5
SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book,My son likes brushing elmo\'s teeth. Almost too nice of a book to let the kids play with haha :),5
SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book,This was a birthday present for my 2 year old grandchildren.  They love this book and will sit and go through it page by page themselves .  The pictures are imaginative and appeal to young children.  Would buy it again!,5
"SoftPlay Giggle Jiggle Funbook, Happy Bear","This bear is absolutely adorable and I would give it a 5 star rating if it actually giggled or growled like it was suppose to!  I just got it in the mail the other day and was super excited when I saw how cute it was!  If it\'s something as simple as a dead battery I could handle it BUT I can\'t even find a place where the batteries would to!  Such a disappointment....it\'s going back and I have no gift to take down to my new Granddaughter, Kenzie, now!",2
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book,"My baby absolutely loves Elmo and so this book seemed perfect for her.  I\'m happy to say I was right:  this book is nice and soft and beautifully illustrated so my little one takes it everywhere and ""reads"" it all of the time. While Elmo is the main character of because he hides on each page, other Sesame Street characters are also featured which is fun, too. Another great, interactive, Elmo centric book that I would recommend for the Sesame Street/Elmo lovers is ""Twinkle, Twinkle Elmo"" (which is also available on Amazon for a great price).",5
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book,"I bought two for recent baby showers!  The book is soft and interactive, great for any baby, and the bright colors are beautiful.  Lastly, who doesn\'t love Elmo!",5
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book,"We wanted to get another book like the Big Birds Friends softplay book, and we only found the two Elmo books. This one is fun, but the Big Bird book has more variety and is more creative.",4
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book,This is a cute little peek-a-boo story book.  It\'s soft.  It\'s safe.  And it is easy for baby to handle.,4
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book,"My 3 month old son loves this book. We read it over and over and he smiles and laughs every time we find Elmo and say &#34;peekaboo Elmo!&#34;  We have a few different soft books and this is the most colorful and fun to read. And baby adores it, so 5 stars for sure.",5
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where\'s Elmo A Children\'s Book,Very cute interactive book! My son loves this book! The bright colorful illustrations make this great for babies & toddlers.,5
"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame","Bought for granddauchildren and they play with them all the time.  Love reading to them.  Soft, so if they fall on them, they are safe. When they use the Elmo book, the kiss Elmo.  Got when they were 9 mos, now they are two and we are still having fun with them.  They love to see how high they can stack the blocks before it falls over.  I buy as a baby present.",5
"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame","I have teething babies and these were great for entertaining the, and letting them chew and droll all over the, without worrying about ruining them. They were great for setting them off to their side to encourage rolling over and crawling. Great Christmas gift for the younger baby and didn\'t break the bank.",4
"SoftPlay Cloth Book, Love",This book is boring. Nothing to stimulate my granddaughter. It is a waste of money. I would not recommend it,1
SoftPlay Baby\'s First Cloth Books Gift Set,"It is so hard to find cloth books with ACTUAL images on them! So many have unrealistic portrayals of what animals/objects look like, but this one is fantastic. EXACTLY what we were looking for!!When we teach our 1 year old what a ""lion"" is, we want to show him a REAL lion... not a drawing that looks nothing like a real lion.",5
"SoftPlay Cloth Book, Hugs","for the young child, very cute...so happy they can &#34; read&#34; something there is little or no chance of them destroying..many happy reading memories",5
SoftPlay Baby Animals of the World Soft Cloth Book,"not bad but not as interesting to my 1-year old as I thought. Mot interactive [texture, etc] but cute anyway",3

Baby\'s First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,I searched high and low for a first year calendar and settled on this one based on the reviews.  I am so happy that I did.  Perfect for jotting down quick memories throughout the month and remembering dates of baby\'s &#34;firsts&#34;.  Will be fun to look back on.  Also has spots for personalization and pictures.,5
Baby\'s First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,This is a very good gift for a new mother.  You would want to give it to the parents as soon as baby is born so that they can start from the very beginning to chart the &#34;firsts&#34;.  I had one of these calendars for each of my five children.  They enjoy looking up their &#34;firsts&#34; especially as they are now parents themselves.,5
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,,5
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,Absolutely love it and all of the Scripture in it.  I purchased the Baby Boy version for my grandson when he was born and my daughter-in-law was thrilled to receive the same book again.,5
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,Bought as a gift for my daughter in law. She loved it. Simple but a place to put important memories down. I loved the verses at bottom of pages.,4
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,"I didn\'t realize this was a religious product, so I almost returned it.  (Not that I have anything against that, but some of the pages ask for favorite scripture, prayers for the baby, etc.). Wasn\'t sure that fir with out lifestyle, but the book has all the right ages for memories, so we are keeping it.",3
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,OMG.....we loved this baby book! Perfect for the memories you want to remember when your little one gets bigger and starts asking questions. It even had a place for foot and hand prints for when your baby is born which is the main reason why we liked this one. Also it has pockets for keepsakes and little places to put first locks of hair....etc! So cute and is a great baby shower gift!,5
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,"Beautiful book, I love it to record cherished times in my great granddaughters life with the beautiful pastel pink color.",5

My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book,"I was pleasantly surprised upon receiving the memory book entitled,  ""My Kindergarten Year"". It is the perfect way to record one\'s Kindergarten experience through photographs and detailed descriptions of this very important time in your child\'s life. The questions are fun for your child to answer and record while serving its purpose for the parent.I\'d recommend this book to everyone with a Kindergartener.",5
My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book,I\'m so glad I stumbled upon these gem. My son has already started answering questions and I think it will be a great memory to look back years later to see how he answered the questions.,5
Jellycat Elephant and Mouse Book,The book is just a few pages long with a few words to each page.  Just short enough to keep the attention of my 6 month old son.  We have the Elephant as well so when he\'s older it will be neat to see the realization of the association between the stuffed toy and the book character,4
God Created Everything Nite Lite,"This is well made a very pretty,.  It gives a nice light and will be used for years...I recommend it highly.  It also makes a great gift.",5

Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Colorful Butterflies,Would not purchase again or recommend. The decals were thick almost plastic like and were coming off the wall as I was applying them! The would NOT stick! Literally stayed stuck for about 5 minutes then started peeling off.,2
Modern House Winnie the Pooh Swing and Tiger Swing (2 pages) removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,I could not get these Winnie the Pooh themed wall decor stickers in New Zealand and these were a very cost effective option that I was very impressed with.  They were easy to stick on and look fantastic on the wall - they don\'t &#34;look&#34; like stickers at all.  Very professional and very seamless on the paintwork.,5

Reusable Flannel (15) Baby Wipes 100% Cotton Bleached and Unbleached (Flushable Diaper Liners),I love these wipes.  They are so simple and soft and they are a great price for reusable wipes.  They actually get my baby clean and dry during diaper changes.  And I know that I\'ll find a million other uses for them after our diaper days are done.  I\'m ordering more of them right now!,5
Beautiful Girl and Black Flower Removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"It is nice and looks great on my wall. It was just a bit smaller than what I thought, but that was my fault and not taking the measurements.",4
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),We bought the pins as my 6 year old Autistic son was able to open or break open normal safety pins we needed to use for his night time clothes.  These new pins are significantly more sturdy and he hasn\'t learned how to open them and only once has he broken one open.  I seem to recall that their shipping price was more than a bit on the high side of reasonable though given the size of the package...,4
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),These were  good quality--worked fine--heavy duty--able to be used in any way needed and filled my need as no others,2
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),A great safety pin that has lots of uses.  Easy to find with bright colors and a great bargain for a dozen.,5
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"While the diaper pins are attractive, the metal in the pins I received are flimsy and did not hold up to the thick fabric I used them on. Fortunately there was no baby involved, so no little on was stuck.",2
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"These diaper pins went to Honduras to hold the cloth diapers we also sent with the missionaries. It is difficult to find diaper pins in our &#34;disposable&#34; age. In Honduras, they do not have &#34;Pampers&#34;. They appreciated the kits we sent.",5
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"It has been many years since we needed diaper pins, but I do like to pin my socks together through the wash and have never lost one yet. I was using brass dressmaker pins but they tended to open up during the wash cycle. My wife suggested diaper pins and we tried them. Thery\'re working perfectly and staying together through the washing. Matter of fact they can get a little tricky to open, but of course that was the idea. Recommended to keep your socks &#34;friended up&#34;.",5
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"As another reviewer noted, these are great for matching socks before washing.  Now once the socks come out of the washer, I hang them to dry with the pins still on.  The socks stay on the line to dry without clothespins, they just hang with one sock on each side of the line.  After they are dried, I just open the pin and leave it by the hamper on a shelf.  As I put dirty socks into the hamper, I grab a pin and use it.  Has saved a lot of time and I don\'t have the problem of lost socks or mismatched socks on my feet.  Great idea and am glad I read about this here on the reviews.  Wish I had done this my whole life.",5
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"The steel part is not strong at all, unlike the old diaper pins, which I still have.  Very hard to work it through a thicker fabric.  Would not recommend.",1
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),I really thought I was getting a dozen pins..turns out I should have counted the pins in the picture..as there are only 10. I am sad..and I think that they are overpriced. I only use them to mark yarn when I crochet so I will be going back to regular safety pins.,2
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"Like = sharp ends that pierce through my diapers easier.  Dislike = the sides bend which is a pain.  That said, I am pushing them through older velcro tabs because the velcro on my diapers doesn\'t work anymore.",4

Wall-stickers Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Giant Cherry Blossom Tree in Wind,I am pleased with the design I just wish the actual picture was bigger an putting it together doesn\'t make sense the numbers aligned with the branches don\'t make any sense compared to the picture they give you as an instruction -- you have to sort of free hand. I had to start it half way up my wall so it made a difference an could actually be seen -- as far as it hold up I put it up about 2 weeks ago an it had not peeled off at all.,3
Super Mario Game Nintendo Wall Sticker and Decal,These do not stick to the wall. They start to peel as soon as you stick them to the wall.,1
New Style Trailing Cherry Blossom Tree Decal Removable Vinyl Kids Wall Decal Wall Sticker Peel and Stick,Was so excited to get this product for my baby girls bedroom!  When I got it the back is NOT STICKY at all!  Every time I walked into the bedroom I was picking up pieces off of the floor!  Very very frustrating!  Ended up having to super glue it to the wall...very disappointing.  I wouldn\'t waste the time or money on it.,1
Blessed By Pope Francis Franciscan Knotted Our Lady of Grace Italian Made Aurora Borealis Crystal Rosary,"I ordered this Rosary for a friend because it looked lovely in the photo and it is blessed by Pope Francis.  I was not disappointed as it is just beautiful, made with crystal, and knotted in between the Our Fathers.  I am giving this to my friend along with a copy of the novena of Our Lady Untier (or Undoer) of Knots, for whom Pope Francis has a strong devotion.  I definitely recommend this Rosary and would buy it again in a heart beat.",5
Blessed By Pope Francis Infant Jesus of Prague Nino De Praga Medal Charm Pendant,An excellent value and quality for the price.  Just right for wearing around the neck orattaching to a Brown Scapular or some such. And the Blessing makes the Item all the more Precious.,5
Musical Christmas Nativity Scene Angel with Baby Jesus in a Rustic Barkwood Resin Manger 8&quot; Tall,I was so excited to get this nativity.  I have been watching it for months and I finally had an excuse to spend $25.00.  It is beautiful and I am very happy with the look of the item.  I am not so happy about the music box.  The song is WAY too fast and it had to play it through once to even recognize the song.  I don\'t know if there is a way to slow down a music box; if there is I wish someone would tell me.  I still love the nativity but I am not as excited as I would be if the music had been right.Buyer beware... beautiful nativity; not so great music,3

I love the bangles however they are a bit small. Had to slid them on with lotion. I like a snug fitting bangle but whew these were tough to get on!! If my hand was a hair bigger they wouldn\'t have fit. They are on to stay. I have small hands also. I got the size for large kid small adult and they fit wrist but tough over the hand. Overall satisfied with product and fast shipping!,4

"IKEA KLADD PRICKAR Bib, blue, red",I like those bibs. they are very useful. easy to wash and dry. the price is awesome. My friends also like them very much.,4
"IKEA KLADD PRICKAR Bib, blue, red","This bibs provided very good protections for messy eaters, my grandson is a 20 months old beautiful boy who loves to eat his marinara pasta with his fingers.

Holy Family Baby Jesus and Star Nativity Christmas Tree Ornament,"This is such a cute ornament, I collect nativity ornaments and this is perfect for my collection! Can\'t wait to add it to my nativity tree!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",We used this to help us keep track of pees and poops during that first month. It is really helpful if you breastfeed to keep track of feeding patterns and wet diapers to make sure baby is eating enough. Great book!,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","This book is going to be a life saver! We are adopting and when we travel complete the adoption, I needed a book to keep track of baby\'s schedule. I have a terrible memory and this book will be perfect for keeping track of baby\'s schedule. I also love how there is a spot at the beginning for emergency numbers and important info. Perfect for traveling, the babysitter or just for at home use. I will definitely be buying more after I fill this up.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","Love it love it love it!!  Got my first baby tracker as a gift, bought another one as soon as it was used up.  Great for daycare, too, so you can communicate with your provider about baby\'s activities for the day.  Also great for round the clock care- no need to ""remember"" when baby ate last or how much sleep you really got!!  Get it for your new moms- to- be!!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby\'s routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn\'t have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn\'t even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I am 4 weeks from delivery of my first baby and was looking for a newborn tracker. From the reviews I read this one looked like it had everything that one needs to write down and remember, so I bought it. I have not used it but I am very happy with what I saw. Hope it ends up being as useful at it looks.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I\'ve bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby\'s day and development, plus use the ""Notes"" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps ""Dad"" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I got this baby tracker as part of the \'new parents\' package from my work. It is extremely well organized ... much better then others I\'ve seen. It is an iParenting Media Winner and for a good reason. Absolutely worth the $$. I am getting this for all my expecting friends! 5 starts!,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I\'m a new mom and I was looking for something to record my baby\'s daily activities and patterns and it is perfect! It has a lot of space to write down anything extra beyond the diaper changes, feedings and sleeping. I like that it has an area to write down medications. It is a great reminder for dr appointments and to track your baby\'s patterns. I am extremely happy with this book and will be ordering another one for when I run out of pages in 3 months.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",Love this book ....super easy to keep track and sooooooooo helpful for this first time mom ..especially for pediatrician appts,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I loved how this book was set up to keep track of everything important about baby.  I used it for the first year.  I always took it to doctor appointments to share how often she was eating and everything.,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I\'ve been using it since I have my newborn and it\'s a great way to keeping track of baby&#34;s schedule,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I used a tracker with my first son - but I didn\'t so much need to with my second.  This tracker though, is laid out very well and keeps things pretty organized.  My only complaint is that it is not a full year tracker - I did the whole first year with my first son which is nice to refer back to.  I would recommend this book, but if you\'re interested in tracking the whole first year you will need to buy 3 (they run 4 months long).",4
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","This is the best way to keep track of when your baby eats, sleeps, poops, gets a bath, etc. It\'s also a great way to keep track of which side baby nursed on. I took this to all infant doc appt. And it\'s a great gift!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I rarely write a review however, this journal has been a lifesaver.  Sleep deprivation can compromise anyones ability to recall feeding and napping times, which breast was last used, soiled diapers, etc.. I even sleep with my journal to keep it close by so I can document around the clock.  The layout of this journal is very simple and easy to use at a quick glance.  I understand there are phone apps that do the same thing however, I chose this journal to allow my husband and nanny to have access to the information.  A must have and will make a great gift.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I received this at my baby shower and it has been a wonderful gift. I had no idea when I received it what fun it would be to record all this information. I have done this for 2 children now and only wish I would have had it for my first 2 kids.,5
"Large Jungle Animals (Panda, Lion, Elephant, Gorilla) - 3D Wall Murals for Baby Nursery and Kids Rooms - Made in USA",I ordered these for my 7 month old sons play area.  They are very cool.  I love the fact that they can be removed from the wall and moved to a room or house if needed.  I would get these instead of wall decals because they are 1. easier to put up and 2. can be moved without ruining them.  It makes his play area look really cool!,5
Edu-Petit Happy Jungle Day Finger Puppet Book Developmental Toy,My 2 year old grandson got it for Christmas and he loves when his Mommy reads it to him.  Good quality and very well made.  Other positive reviews directed me to buy it.,5
Edu-Petit Teddy Bobo\'s Big Learning Book Developmental Toy,"I bought this for my 17 month old son as a form of quiet, in-crib entertainment when he wakes up at 5am. So far, he likes it a lot... even got an ""ooooooh"" when I first handed it to him.",4
Modern House Thomas Train and Friends removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"i hung these over my sond headboard in his thomas themed room, they havent fallen off the wall, applied a week ago so maybe they will be okay but they seemed kinda cheaply made. they do look good and as i said they havent fallen down, if they do i will be sure to revise my review to avoid anyone else making my mistake.",3
Modern House White Plum Blossom with Green Birds Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"a little difficult if you dont know how you want it to be placed on your wall, so be creative, it comes off easily so you can play around with it.. the result looks beautiful. very peaceful.",5

Modern House Trailing Cherry Blossom Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,I haven\'t put these up yet but I was disappointed in the color of the flowers. They look more purple than pink.,2
Modern House Safari Animal Family removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"the instructions were really clear, howerver the next day the decals started coming off because my wall has ridges on it soooo. I added a little dab of crazy glue and walah! it\'s up.",5
Modern House Safari Animal Family removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,The designs were cut and easy to apply. There was no sticky residue when we peeled it off to readjust and it was to redo the adjustment again and again. It was also just sticky enough to stick to the wall while not too sticky enough to peel the paint off. We like it.,5
Modern House Angry Bird I removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"Grandchildren opened these before they got home and stuck them to everything in my house, even themselves. Hope they will still stick on wall when they get home.",5
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,My daughter started playing with her Music Blocks set when she was just a few months old.  She spent hours entertaining herself.  She is now 18 months old and still loves this toy.  Now she understands how to arrange the blocks and has great fun making new musical patterns.  I highly recommend the Jumpin\' Jive Jazz cartridge -- it\'s her favorite -- and the Bach cartridge when you want calmer music.,5
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"It takes a youthful spirit of inquiry and fascination to play with blocks and pre-programmed music. Anyone too old to play with blocks (or to young to play with them again) may back off. But they\'re missing a revolution in interactive toys. Each colored block represents part of a musical score, and each side on the block represents one way of delivering that piece, such as horn, violin, or voice. Turning and swapping blocks thus generates changes in the music played, with incredible variety. You (and, oh yes, the child too) will run out of steam long before you run out of interest. And the use of additional block sets expands the use and interest even more. Bravo!!",5
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,This was one of my favorite toys-but beware if you buy this I went through 3 of these- and the company no longer exists-so if there is a problem with it-you are out of luck,3
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"Our whole family loved the Mozart music blocks. I even bought another &quot;disk&quot; of music. Unfortunately, it was a constant challenge to keep the kids from destroying the delicate &quot;chip&quot; that was easily accessible. Finally it broke and I felt it was too expensive to replace. I feel that a toy at this price should be more durable. My suggestion would be to hide the &quot;plug in chip&quot; so that the kids aren\'t attracted to it. We have a 3-year old and a one-year old. The toy lasted about 6 months.",4
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"This is an interesting and educational toy.  I got it for my 2 year old, and while she loved mixing up the blocks, she also loved pulling out the cartridge and couldn\'t put it back in.  That means I had to go put the cartridge back every 5 minutes.  If the cartridge were placed on the side or back, I don\'t think the littler ones would be so inclined to pull it...out of sight out of mind.",4
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"Great idea, but the toy IS NOT durable.  After returning one toy for not working, another one has broken.  What a disappointment!!  And the customer service is non-existant and when it is, they are rude!!!! Someone let me know when the class-action lawsuit will occur.",1
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,I bought this 18 months ago for my 6 year old and 2 year old.  They both loved it.  I bought additional cartridges then it stopped working.  We replaced the batteries twice and it still does not work.  It was expensive for a toy that did not last very long.,4
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"I spent [a lot of money] when this thing first came out, and it worked TERRIBLY!  I sent it back to the company because it was defective and wouln\'t shut up.  They sent me another one.  It worked very inconsistently.  When I called the manufacturer I was told ""Well, it\'s a very sensitve computer, you can\'t just let them toss it around, that must be why you\'re having trouble""  Actually, I was having my 2 year sit in his high chair while I supervised him, and he was not doing anything to it.  I mean, it says it\'s for 2 year olds on the box....  Anyway, I returned it and got my money.  SAve your money for real music lessons.",5
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,Recently I have purchased the musical mozart blocks set for my two and a half year old daughter at a toys r us department store near me as a Christmas gift for her this year and they had one of the toys out on display. She loved the toy and it is very educational. I had a hard time leaving the store because she wanted to continue to play with it although she is young enough that even though she was with me while I purchased her toys for Christmas this year that she had completely forgotten about it and that I haought this toy for her. My only complaint is that I had to pay [$$$] for this toy and they had told me that the sale on the toy had ended yesterday but this toy I knew was still available online here for [$$$] which is a really good price and I do not think it is right for them to sell it for the other price when it can be bought cheaper. Anyways I liked the toy alot and my daughter did too and that is why I purchased the toy even at the price I  had to pay for it. I think it will get a lot of use out of it and so will my 8 month old daughter when she is old enough as well.,5
"Milestones, Kids\' Step Stone Kit",Product was very easy to use.  I helped my son (16 months at the time) make a stepping stone for Father\'s Day.  He put the stones in himself and it turned out really cute.,5
Sesame Street Baby Purse Playset,"My girls love this Sesame Street purse! There are 5 items that can be placed inside of the purse. They use it when they pretend to go shopping around the house. It was a little tricky for my 18 month old to figure out how to open it but she eventually learned. The bright colors, durable design and sweet Sesame Street character faces make it such a fun purchase!",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 months old.  He loves all the little animals, but even now at 8 months, he doesn\'t seem interested in putting them in the fish bowl.  However, he will take them out if they are in there.  My son is very active, so maybe that\'s contributing to why he doesn\'t really use the bowl...",3
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,I purchased this item for my son and its going to be returned the star fish he cant hold on to the fish the only thing he can hold on to was the crab and he liked that because it crinkled.. This is not Our favorite Lamaze toy and it will be going back to the store..,3
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"My one-year-old baby loves this toy!  She loves to take the fish in and out, and watch through the transparent sides as she takes them in and out.  She loves to play peek-a-boo through the sides.  She loves to shake/squeeze each fish to hear its noise.  Downside: the fish are easy to misplace, so keeping all four together is a challenge.",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this toy to help stimulate my eight-month-old\'s development. When I got it in the mail, I immediately opened it and gave it to her. She has been playing with it since. Her favorite is the crinkle crab because she can make him make noise. She is fascinated by the others. She very quickly learned how to take them out and put them back into the bowl. She has had no difficulty in doing that. Great item, worth the money!! And it is so fun to watch!!",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"Everyone knows nap time can be difficult, my daughter fights it everyday, sometimes she\'ll even jump around and hit the sides of her crib. We decided putting some of those cribside toys made of hard plastic was unrealistic at this point, however I saw this and got it right away.Although we had tried stuffed animals and other soft toys this works he best. It\'s a lot more interactive compared with just hugging her teddy bear. Everyday she plays with it, it also occupies her in the morning when she first wakes. I walk into her room and there she is holding her fishy. Plus if she rolls on it during the night there\'s no chance of hurting herself. She loves it.Great value! Something a little different.",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,This is a very good toy that helps manual dexterity and the ability to recognize figures behind the clear plastic. My baby girl especially loves the crinkle crab and the clam !,5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,We first bought this toy for our oldest child when she was just beginning to sit up and play with toys.  She would sit in her crib and play for a hour or more just putting the sea creatures in and out.  It gave Mommy shower and make-up time!  We believe she loved the clear plastic on the bowl and the shape and feel of the pieces.  We had the same experience with daughter #2.  We have bought this several times for other new parents.  Our girls have also received similar toys (not Lamaze) ex: a cookie jar and have not enjoyed it anywhere near as much.  A little toy with big entertainment value!,5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I saw this toy before I was pregnant and though it was so cute!So after I had my daughter, I had the best excuse to buy it!!!She loves it.  I bought it for her when she was about 3 months old.  She\'d chew on the little clam.  Now she uses it to learn that they make noise, and she can put them in and take them out of the bowl.It\'s worth the money.  Cute, educational, (quiet.. heh), and durable.",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"We received this as a present for our 6 month old.  I don\'t really think she\'s old enough to put the individual toys in the fishbowl, but she sure loves playing with them!  I\'ve noticed that she likes &quot;crinkly&quot; toys, so she loves the crab.  So far, it has kept her very entertained.  I really like Lamaze products so far",4
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this toy for my baby and for friends\' babies as well. The babies really love the faces on the toys and get a kick out of the different sounds each one makes. They enjoy looking at them through the clear plastic and taking them out and putting them back in over and over. Most kids seem fascinated by ocean creatures anyway, so I think it\'s bound to be a guaranteed &quot;hit&quot; for any child. My 2 1/2 year old still loves to play with the crab!",4
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"This toy was given to my son by his grandmother.  I saw Lamaze and immediately thought it would be a great toy.  Not the case.My son received this fish bowl when he was about 4 months old.  He is now 9 months.  He chews on the crab for hours, but other than that not much else.  I feel that this is an expensive teething toy.I like the variety of color and the different textures of fabric the toy offers.",2
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this for my son when he was 6mos.  He LOVED it!  What great little teethers each of the sea creatures make.  However, 1.5mos down the road, he totally ignored it.  It was beyond his developmental path.  Cute toy, but I\'m not sure it\'s worth it.",3
Pedal Farm Tractor,"We chose this tractor and trailer for a family gift for our two-year-old son and he loves it!  Visiting friends love it, too.  We looked at several others, but this one seemed to be the safest and most durable.  He cannot pedal the tractor yet, but loves to push it around or be pushed while sitting on it and will soon grow to it (he is tall).  The trailer is a great addition and our son loves to fill it with toys (or his little brother!).  The only negative is that the ""hitch"" for the trailer does not lock in place and can be turned causing the trailer to come off at bad times, but we would still recommend it.  The assembly was easy and our little farmer has been thrilled!",5
Pedal Farm Tractor,I bought this for my son when he was 3 years old.  He is now 8 and handed it down to my younger son when he turned 2.  After 5 years of rough and tough riding it is just now starting to break down.  This has been an awesome toy.  We also purchased the trailer and the boys have loved them both.  I think it would have lasted even longer if my 8 year old would have stayed off of it after he had outgrown it.  Anyway the only thing you need to keep in mind is that there is no brake so be careful on hills.,5
Pedal Farm Tractor,"We bought this tractor to accompany the trailer.  Our grandsons are big into farm stuff and love to load up the trailer and pretend they are working ""on the farm.""  It is best for those old enough to reach the pedals (age 3 and up?).  It is very sturdy and durable.  Great toy for those busy toddlers and preschoolers.  Worth every penny it cost!",5
Pedal Farm Tractor,"We bought this tractor for our 2 and a half-year-old son, and he is able to pedal and manuever this vehicle very well, despite the recommended age of 3-6 years. This tractor is very sturdy, and nearly impossible to tip over. My son has deserted all other riding toys in favor of this tractor. I highly recommend purchasing the yellow trailer that is specifically made for this tractor, but is sold separately .... My son loads all kinds of treasures into the trailer and farms the yard for long periods of time....",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"We bought these for our son when he turned two. He had seen them at a playmate\'s home and LOVED them. I liked them b/c unlike some of the other cars for sale...there is some learning value and they are VERY durable. They have been thrown, rolled, stepped on, etc and still show no signs of wear. Highly recommend!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son loves stacking cups, so a friend recommended this toy to me.  My son loves it and he enjoys pushing them around the floor.  They nest nicely into each other, which makes it a great toy for the diaper bag.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son Cameron just loves these great little stacking cars!  He enjoys stacking them and slapping them down and each has great little things that they do such as his fire truck has a ladder that clicks up and down, police car has a spinning &quot;light&quot; bar, and so on.  I think it\'s great, brightly colored and has great little faces....I would give this as a gift in the future, not a wasted toy, Oh the little wheels roll, too!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My one year old son received these as a birthday gift. He loves them. Not only are they stackable, which helps with hand-eye coordination, but each car has individual moveable features. Although these features are small, they got his attention. The bright colors are nice also. They are a great buy for the price!  I highly recommend them as first trucks for a small child.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,I purchased this toy for my great grandson\'s first Christmas. He will be 6 months old. I can\'t wait to play with it with him. This is the first baby in our family for 18 years and all the family is waiting for the fun... I will be ordering a lot more soon. Thank you for the convenient shopping. AJ\'S Gee-Gee (Great Grandmom),5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I\'ve owned this set for several years.  My 4 granddaughters love to play with the cars.  Stacking, nesting, playing with the few moving parts.  It is one of their favorite toys when they come over.  And it is definitely one of mine - Lots of play value that stores very well.  They have learned colors, and numbers with these also.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We\'ve traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don\'t take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a great toy.  The wheels really work and each car has a special feature.  They store easily for packing on trips and putting away.  Both of my kids (boy and girl) have played with them.  They are brightly colored.  And best of all, these do not use batteries!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My 11 month old received these last Christmas and he instantly began running them along the floor and playing with them. He is now 22 months and I have taught him his colors using these and he STILL loves to play with them.  One got run over by an electric scooter and it didn\'t even break! All parents should get these for your baby.  This is the one toy that will NOT sit and collect dust!,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My 14 month old son loves to stack and play with these little cars.  They are durable and easy to clean.  I throw them in  the diswasher and they hold up great.  They are well worth the money to me.,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"Great toys, we always pack one or two in the diaper bag, our 7 month old loves to play with them and I don\'t worry at all about him chewing on these toys as there are only smooth surfaces",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son has played with these from 6 months old, and still likes them occasionally (18 months now).  The small car is nice for babies to shake.  They don\'t do much, but they are cute.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,After being inundated with toys that require batteries and make so much noise this was a breath of fresh air. My son loves these vehicles! We got this when he was 6 months old. We stack them on top and he loves to knock it over. We nest them and he loves to find the surprise vehicle underneath. Now that he is 8 months old he is figuring out that the wheels move as well as some of the other moving features on each vehicle. I highly recommend this toy.,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I bought these for my 1 1/2 year old, and he loves them (and so does his 5-year old brother). They both stack the cars, hide them and ""vrroomm"" them. It is great to find a toy that doesn\'t need batteries or require an engineering degree to put together!Highly recommended.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren\'t too big- a perfect size!,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son got this stacking truck set as a baby gift.  He was able to play with the trucks at about 6 months and they are still played with today (my son will be 2 next month). The overall durability of this toy is great; they look as good as when we got them even after lots of play and being taken along on many trips. I have not seen this toy in any store - so get it here while you still can!  It has been a much used toy and I highly recommend it for your small child.,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I bought the cars because they were easy to store, plus they were cars.  What I have found is that I can actually use then in many places since there is more than one vehicle.  Mostly they are easy to pack for a trip.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My daughter loves these vehicles. She likes to watch them disappear as you stack them inside each other. And she loves to stack them atop of each other. Then she plays with them as cars, and even makes the sounds they make. They are wonderful fun toys, and great to take with you on trips, they are compact!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son loves this stacking toy. It is much more fun than the stackable rings toy even though he does have that one too. All the boys at our baby group have it and the babies who don\'t always come up to see what it is all about! You can\'t go wrong with this purchase.,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I got this toy for my daughter when she was very little.  She really hasn\'t been interested until recently.  Now she loves to put little people inside the cars and look at them through the top.  She lets objects play hide-and-seek under the cars but she really doesn\'t stack them or nest them very much.  I think they are worth the money because they were fairly cheap but she hasn\'t really used them for the intended purpose.  I don\'t think I would buy them again but I certainly wouldn\'t take them back if they were given to me. I think my daughter will use them in different ways with other toys, in the tub or pool or even outside as she grows.  They are extremely durable.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"Okay, well they don\'t really beep.  (But my 11-month old son loves when we roll these along and SAY &quot;beep beep!&quot;)  At this point, my son\'s favorite aspect of these cars is the little sunroof, siren and ladder on the tops.  He can sit there for ten minutes just flipping the sunroof back and forth!  Go figure!  These cars are super sturdy and have taken quite a beating on our coffee table.  (They\'re in much better shape than the coffee table at this point.)  I love that they nest together so they don\'t take up too much space when they\'re put away.  I also like that he can grow into them once he understands the nesting/stacking part better.  A great toy...gets played with each and every day!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars. They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new. Fun to stack, fun to roll. Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"We just bought this for my 9 month old daughter,she loves these cars, loves to turn the wheels and lookat the faces. She especially loves the little green car,it\'s the perfect size to fit in her tiny hand and it rattles.This toy is a hit! I highly recommend it.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son got this for Christmas and he loves all the cars.  His favorite is the fire truck.  He plays with it for a while.,4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck\'s ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son\'s favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.",5
Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,"My mother-in-law bought 2 of these for our twin boys-- one for each crib-- and they have been a life saver in getting our boys to settle down at night and go to sleep. Now our boys do not sleep without it! Anytime we are going somewhere overnight, we take at least one with us. It is also the only toy that plays music by itself for more than 30 sec. It will play for about 10 minutes!! It\'s our standard gift for all of our parent friends.",5
Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,"My daughter had this in her crib until she was 2 and loved it.  When she got old enough she loved to turn it on and off by herself.  I used this every night for her to go to sleep by. I used the place that you store the remote control in for extra pacifiers, so if she lost one during the night she would know where to find one.  I never used the remote, but loved the idea another had about putting in the car for rear facing infants when they get fussy you could just turn it on with the remote.  It\'s not too bright and the volume is adjustable.  Someone had said it eat batteries quickly,but I found that they lasted a very LONG time and I used it EVERY night. I highly recommend this product!!",5
Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,I bought this product when my son was about 10 months old.  He was still having problems going to sleep at night and naptime.  The Slumbertime Soother is great.  I sing along with the songs.  My son turns it on himself and sometimes just plays with it.  The nature sounds relax him.  I really like the fact that it plays for ten minutes without stopping.,5
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"I bought this toy for an addition to my son\'s exerciser. However, it would not stick (to anything)!! I tried everything to make it stick. It was very frustrating.",1
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"i bought this beautie at k mart for 5 bucks. other that the suction cup not really working out well, my 3 month old loves it. hell, my husband and i also enjoy playing with it. it has a variey of colours and shapes that help stimulate the mind. you cant lose.",4
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"I bought this to use on the high chair, but within 2 days my son had the rattle part off the base. Needless to say it never went back on for more than 5 min. BUT he did enjoy it in the car and other places.",3
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"My son loved this toy.  He enjoyed playing with it in his highchair until he was 10 months old.  At that point he was strong enough to pull the toy from its\' base.  He pulled it so hard, he smashed himself in the face with it.  After that upsetting experience, we didn\'t put it in the base anymore.  He did still play with it as a rattle, but it did not hold his attention as well.  I would like to see this toy redesigned so that it cannot be separated from its\' base.",3
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"My son is nearly a year old and received this toy about 9 months ago.  We both love Sassy toys.  This one is bright and amusing.  Stick it on a car window, high chair tray, restaurant table, bathroom tile,...  We were disappointed in the life of the suction cup, but for all other reasons--color, amusement, education, and co-ordination--get one of these!",5
Sassy Smiley Face Rattle,"This toy is very cute, it has two handles for little hands to grasp, a mirror on one side and on the other the smiley face! the face has wiggly eyes and a nose to beep. but the nose can be frusterating for babies as my 18month old son still has a hard time beeping it! my all in all a cute,durable toy!!",5
Sassy Circle Rattle,My son (who is now 2+ yrs) loved this rattle as a baby.  He loved it so much that I have given it to all of my mommy- friends as a gift.  This is the best toy to have for a young baby.  You will get them to smile for those all-important-photos with this one!!,5
Sassy Circle Rattle,"Both of my sons love this toy. My two year old played with it when he was a baby, and it found its way to the bottom of his toy box at Granny\'s. We found it about a month ago and his 5 month old baby brother began to play with it. Suprise Suprise he loves it too! And his big brother tries to steal it away. This toy is durable, and fun. What more could mom ask for??",5
Sassy Circle Rattle,"What I don\'t love about this is that the clear part, where the baby can watch the beads move with motion, contains BPA.  However, my daughter found this rattle a comfort to her while teething and chewed only the big protruding ball, which as far as I know is free from both PVC and BPA.  I thought she would like the textures of the rings, but nope, it was all about the ball.Also appreciated the bright colors.  This is a good bang for your buck baby toy -- for a while there we always had it in the diaper bag when we left the house.Best at about 6-12 months.  Can\'t see it getting a lot of use before 3 months and just not interesting to a toddler, even a toddler who is still teething.",5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"I was concerned about the chemical content of this ""plastic"" book since a baby will undoubtedly stick it in his mouth. I emailed Sassy and got a reply saying that this was BPA, PVC and Phtalates free. I can breathe a sigh of relief when I hand this to our baby...soon!",5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"We bought this for our 5 month old and put pictures of relatives that live far away inside the pages.  The book is very sturdy, &quot;chewable&quot; and has a lot of great colors/designs to look at.  Now at 8 months, this book is still one her favorites!  Plus she sees her grandma\'s and grandpa\'s, etc, faces every day.  We love it.",5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,I bought this for a new granddaughter.  I will not get to see her often as she lives in another state.  This book is great for out pictures and she can carry it around and look at the pictures as she would a book.  This way she can recognize us when we show up.  It is easy to carry and cleaning it is simple.  It is a great little photo book.,5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"I originally bought this for my 4 month old son, but my 17 month old daughter has taken it over.  We filled it with pictures of mom and dad, 2 sets of grandparents, and all the cousins with their families (there are only 6 slots for pics, but we took pictures of entire families - so we have 20 people in all).  She loves pointing to the pictures and identifying various people.  The pages are made out of thin plastic material and filled with foam, so are pretty soft, but still durable. The slots are sized for 3x5 inch pictures.  My 4 month old hasn\'t gotten much out of it yet, but I\'m sure he\'ll love it just as much in months to come.",5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,This is a nice photo book for babies as it has clear plastic sleeves to protect the pictures you place inside.,5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"Based on articles on the dangers of PVC plastic books, this book was tested and found to contain chemicals that are highly toxic for babies and toddlers. This materials have already been banned from children\'s toys in Europe.In order to read the many articles online that specifically name this book as having been found to contain chemicals that are dangerously toxic for children, google ""toxic bath books"" or the title of the book with the word ""toxic.""This book\'s concept is wonderful, but those who love children should share photos in another kind of album or book.",1
Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings,"We received an Earl E. Bird as a gift when we had our first baby eleven years ago. Since then, Earl has seen us through teething for three kids, and is still in good condition for our fourth baby!  He\'s a little faded around the edges, but just as loveable and soft, with difference textures for a chewy, drooly baby to gnaw on.I like that he\'s fully washable, and a nice quiet toy (at least in ours, the squeaker was very quiet to begin with and has since kind of stopped squeaking--but the squeaker was never the big attraction with Earl).  Perfect for taking on planes, or in church, or in the car. A great baby shower gift, since Earl is perfect for a boy or a girl.",5
Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings,"This little toy is safe for infants, and offers great color, texture and even sound.  Very Sweet, though a little pricey.",5

"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",This is exactly like the one I had when I was a kid. My son really enjoys it and it keeps him entertained.,5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","I had a book similar to this as a child and it brings back wonderful memories! My 20 month old struggles with several of the items, such as the shoe laces and snaps. But he loves the zipper and the Velcro shapes and the other pages give him a great way to learn and practice. Overall it\'s an item that he can grow into and it\'s super cute!",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","My daughter enjoys taking it apart more than putting it back together, but a great product.  It has kept her occupied while flying.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","Got this for a plane ride 3 months ago. The snaps are hard to snap and he gets frustrated. Most pieces are attached to the book which is nice, he can\'t lose them. He flips thru it but that is about it. Maybe when we travel again he will find it more interesting. We keep it for trips only so it will be ""new"" each time. He has seen it up on the shelf and asks for it but when we give it to him he is done flipping thru in a few minutes and it is left on the floor for other books.",4
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",I bought this for my grandbaby for Christmas. She loves it and my daughter kept saying it was such a neat toy.,5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",My 8 month toddler enjoys this book. Very good idea with mind-stimulating activities on each page. Well worth it for the price.,5

"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","I really like this book. You can show your baby shapes, teach her how to use buttons, zipper and snaps, tie a shoe and tell time. My baby is too young for most of these activities at this time, but she already loves to play with this book. I see a lot of quality time spent with this book in the future.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","My 2 yr+ old grand daughter liked this book a lot.  She did have a hard time with some the buttons or snaps.  They were sewn pretty tight to the backing and was kind of hard to get her fingers under to be able to button or snap.  Overall, she did enjoy each activity.",4
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"I ordered this book for the up-coming birthday of a grandson. It really is cute and an excellent quality. It comes with a small stuffed bear that you can remove from the book. Each page of the book has a different night-time activity for the bear to do such as have a glass of milk, brush his teeth etc. I\'m not exactly sure what I was expecting because even though it is a quality toy I\'m not sure that Liam will use it enough to make it worth the price I paid.  The Pockets of Learning toys all seem to be very high quality if somewhat pricy.",4
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"Both of my boys liked playing with this book.  They also liked to take the bear out and play with him.  The pajamas are a little hard to put on, but they didn\'t seem to care much.  My youngest actually has slept with the little bear!",4
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"This book is very cute, and despite other comments I found it to be well made. My son is not real interested though but maybe he will later on. I just think that it doesn\'t have enough pages and interactivity for the price you are paying.",3
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"This is a cute, interactive book made out of fabric. It walks you though the night routine (1. Drink your milk, 2. Brush your teeth, 3. Take off your clothes, 4. take a bath, 5. Put on pajamas, 6. Bedtime story, 7. Say a prayer, 8. Lullaby and goodnight) - works well for praying people - unfortunately, I bought it for an agnostic family!",3
Baby Monitor - Direct Link Privacy Monitor,"Considering how horrible the selection is these days for choosing a quality baby monitor that doesn\'t transmit to anyone and everyone who may be listening in, intentionally or unintentionally, this seems to be one of the best choices to make.  Your scrambled voice will sound like Donald Duck on a regular analog 46-49 mhz cordless phone or radio scanner, so it\'s at least a moderate roadblock for the average signal interceptor.  However, why on earth there is no 900 mhz (or higher) digital-spread-spectrum baby monitor on the market is beyond me.  So, this unit is one of the better compromises out there, and at ... on amazon.com, it is amazingly affordable.",3
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Blue, Blue Stripe, Medium","This is a perfect baby gift:  washable, no parts on which to choke, snuggly, VERY durable and best of all you can give the same gift to all children in the family, by just monogramming an ear.",5
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Blue, Blue Stripe, Medium","My 3 year old son goes EVERYWHERE with Blue Bunny. This is his 6th one since he was born.

He is so soft and cozy. Great friend for small children.",5

Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy,"This is an iteresting ball that my baby has loved from about 6 months to 18+ months.  The chime is pleasant, not annoying and this ball is easy for a baby to pick up and manipulate.  It is my understanding that the Sassy line is BPA and Phalate free, so you dont have to worry about your child putting this toy in her mouth.",5
Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy,"This toy is a hardier toy than most, I found it is a great toy for my middle sized parrots who love to play with balls with bells in them. So far this toy has lasted almost a year now.",5

Pooh Baby\'s First Tigger,Perfect for young children and overall good quality for the price.,5
Pooh Baby\'s First Tigger,"I actually got the ""Pooh"" one which for some reason is not advertised on babiesrus.com/amazon.I believe that toys like this sometimes are more for the parents as opposed to the babies, but still it is a cute toy!  It went with my newborn son everywhere we went because it fit perfectly with him in his carrier and it was a cute, small toy we could use to interact with.  At 9-months-old he\'s not at that age where he\'s hugging, chewing, just all out playing with his toys and he likes it for that reason.  But babies need more that just stuffed animals.  He\'s obviously much more interested in toys that make sounds or light so his Pooh mostly stays in his room with the other \'dolls\'.This is still a cute item.  I haven\'t had to wash it yet, but it sure is durable.",5
Pedella Wooden Push Toy,"This is a must have for any toddler!  I bought one for my brothers triplets who were 1 1/2 years old at the time.  They loved it!  One would push & the other 2 would chase after it.  They love watching the duck waddle & its feet go round & round.  Best of all, no batteries!  Yaayyyy!!Fifteen years ago, I bought my daughter a little push clown from the same company.  It was her favorite toy & was passed onto her brother.  With heavy playing by 2 children it never lost any of its paint or parts.  It\'s something we are saving for grandchildren one day.",5
Infant Stim-mobile,"Love this mobile!  It is challenging and their eyes are drawn to it.  My son couldn\'t look at it until he got older as he didn\'t like high contrast, but at @ 7 mo he got into it.  If you are a parent who appreciates observing the small nuances of learning that occur in the development process--you will be able to witness it with this toy.  I\'m not a parent trying to turn my children into geniuses, but definitely into maximizing their capabilities to incite their own curiosities.  Keeping children zoned out is not a priority--so for those who want to do that--turn on the tv and buy toys with bells and whistles.  For others, get toys like this one.",5
Infant Stim-mobile,"We found this at a garage sale and I read about it and it seemed really interesting so I bought it. This is for the first few months of a baby\'s life and should not move much, contrary to what the first poster said, because you want stimulation but you don\'t want to over-stimulate a baby. However, we did notice that sometiems our baby does like the mobile to move and it is summer here but the air conditioner blowing air around the room should be enough movement. When it\'s not moving, we can just put a small fan on its lowest setting about 6 feet from the crib and the small wiggling was enough movement to keep her stimulated but not so much movement that she can\'t keep track of the object (babies this young are not good at tracking so you don\'t want a lot of motion), but still we only do this once in a while, not at all times.One of the best things about this mobile is that our baby only wakes us up at night to feed. If she wakes herself up she will sit and stare at it for a long time and be happy since we have a small nightlight in the room. Any time we put her in the crib we can see her staring at the simple shapes. Shown in the picture on the product page is the detailed shapes, you flip the cardboard from the simple to the detailed shapes when they are about 2 months old, then remove this mobile for a more \'traditional\' one with movement and objects the baby can grab at about 4 months. This is a somewhat delicate mobile since it uses air currents to move, so you need to keep it safe from a grabbing/eating baby.Also, one nice feature is that ours came with a travel pack, or at least that\'s how I\'m using it. Besides the crib mount, there is an 8 inch circular plastic ring with fishing wire for hanging the mobile. You can hang it anywhere with a string, either taping string to the ceiling or tying it to any overhang. It also came with a cardboard carrying case thing which is very thin and easy to take with you on a trip.For those with a math/science background, it\'s really interesting to note that first side of the cards have objects with very low spatial frequency. The \'detailed\' sides are actually the same patterns, but with a moderately higher spatial frequency. After 4 months, you use standard mobiles, which have very high spatial frequencies, as well as colors and things the baby can grab to improve hand-eye coordination. Basically, you start showing the child very low frequency objects that are easy to observe and track, then gradually move up until they can use the high frequency information.Now, I want to explain why I did not give this item 5 stars even though it\'s an amazing product. Before my baby was a month old, I noticed that she was already able to detect some colors and this stim-mobile is only black and white. This is from 1990, so I guess over the last 20 years they have refined the product so that the simple side has some red (first color a baby sees) and other simple colors, while the reverse side has more vivid colors, but uses the same idea of going from low spatial frequencies to higher spatial frequencies. I ordered the newest version but still kept this around for changing table and pack n play entertainment since she loves it. If I had not known about the improved version, I would have given it 5 stars, but there is something better available so I highly recommend getting the updated version for every newborn.",4
Fisher Price - Baby Bowling,I\'m really disappointed with this toy.  It never kept my daughter\'s attention.,1
Fisher Price - Baby Bowling,"Cute toy, durable and is simple. Nothing sings, light up or dances...just what our kids truly need. Everything talks, spins, lights up....it is hard to find SIMPLE stimulation toys that kids have to manipulate themselves. This set challenges kids mentally as they try to figure out a. how to roll a ball b. how to aim the ball c. how to knock the pins down d. how to pick up the wobbly little guys. also you can tell your child \'aim for the red guy\' or \'aim for the yellow guy\'. great for teaching basic colors and counting too. don\'t forget you can always say WOW you knocked ONE over...and so forth. great all around and gets tossed around too so clearly after using for a month and being bashed on teh floor by little hands trying to figure out how to bounce the not bouncy ball (exploration) nothing has broken.",5
Rattlesnake Squirt,"Not that==> I &lt;==would -- ever -- do it, or recommend it, but there is a gag called theRattlesnake Eggsprank.It is nothing more than a simple mechanism hidden in an envelope that says:""WARNING: RATTLESNAKE EGGS. KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT TO AVOID HATCHING!""I can just picture someone putting a few of these prank envelopes in the backseat of""somebody\'s"" car next to one of these snakes. The first slight bump -- while driving --will produce a r=a=t=t=l=i=n=g sound which should MORE than just shake someone upwhen they look behind them and noticethe SNAKE!What an excellent, cruel, gag. Not for your parents---or grand parents---for OBVIOUS reasons!",5
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"This product was very innovative when introduced in 1997-8.  It sold at FAO Schwarts for about $100 and we got it for our 18 month old daughter.  She used it until she was at least 3 (we then moved to Reader Rabbit).  The way it worked then -  you plugged the key board into the printer port and the sw was on two CDs. The keyboard did not require mouse skills, just visual selection of very large buttons.  Very interactive, very educational for the toddler/preschool set.  The developer was Israeli and they did not have good US distribution.  It now seems that they finally found someone to distribute it.",5
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"I have to say, the first time we played with this I thought it was going to be a dud and I was thinking I would send it back.  It\'s very simple and not much interaction to it.  But it turns out my 2 year old daughter loves it.  She gets a kick out of it and it\'s all she needs in a toy.(This is the Comfy PC and not the Elmo toy.)",4
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"My daughter loves this product! It covers her 2 favorite things the PC and the phone! Whenever I am on the computer she is always on my lap trying to push whatever keys she can, but with this I can put her in her highchair and put her in front of the PC and she will entertain herself for at least an hour!  She espicially loves the phone aspect on the side and what I love is there is no cord to worry about. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone with a toddler, I started using this with my daughter when she was 12 months old, she is now 15 months and loves it more now that she has gone up to another level!",4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"all three of my kids have had one of these teethers, and it\'s been the favorite for all of them. i buy one for any expectant friend or family member. in our experience, the batteries last about a year & 1/2.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I\'ve tried this for almost 6 months at different points of our kid teething and she\'s just not that into this. It\'s really heavy for a baby. When I would hold the vibrating setting on my kid would watch for a bit and even try it but just seemed bored with it and would move on. The yellow part also attracts dust and fiber out of the air like a magnet. It is ALWAYS dirty. I\'m not that particular when it comes to dirt and baby stuff but it grosses me out. It\'s also only wire clean, so it\'s a more high maintenance toy.",2
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This teether is ridiculous. It\'s huge, it\'s hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It\'s just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion.",1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,One of my friends recommended this for me for my daughter when she was teething. It was the only thing that made her stop crying when she was teething and I tried everything imaginable. I had to hold it to make it vibrate because her mouth wasn\'t strong enough but it made her so happy and cuddly that is far from a complaint. Have recommended it to lots of my friends and they all love it.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Great teether as it has a good texture, is easy to handle and massages the gums while baby is chewing on it.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I ordered this product after reading many of the other reviews, and I\'m also pleased with this purchase. My daughter is 10-months-old and her first tooth just came through, and we\'d tried everything to soothe her gums: ice cubes, teething rings, cold washcloths, you name it. At first she wasn\'t terribly interested in the toy, but then I took it and put it in my mouth and handed it back to her. She put it in her mouth, and I squeezed the other side to make it vibrate. The look on her face was priceless! Her eyebrows went up and I noticed she bit down harder (so I could let go), and she seemed to really like the vibration. This has since become her go-to toy when her gums seem to bother her. Also, I discovered she likes to have the little roller on the handle rubbed up and down her back. All in all this is a really well made toy that worked for my daughter exactly how I\'d hoped.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My 10 month old grandson thought the movement of this toy was funny! He laughs when it moves! Saying this, he does put it in his mouth but pulls it out to laugh So, I love this Teether because it makes him so happy NOT because it massages his teeth!",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My four month old started teething around two months, he has pretty impressive motor skills when it comes to using his hands but this teether is huge and you really have to apply quite a bit of pressure for it to vibrate. My other son who is two and also teething shows absolutely no intrest in this at all. Maybe in a couple more months....",1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,It is a good teether for my handicapped student. But the ability to bit down is required which is hard for my student.,4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"It is a great toy for them to chew and play with, but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on. The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but it does not seem to bother my son a bit.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My daughter is two months and loves this in her mouth.  She seem to like the points and the softer rubber than theInfantino Vibrating Strawberry Teether.  Also it requires less pressure to make vibrate.  No she is not teething yet and no she cannot make it vibrate yet.  But if you pinch it for her, their are three different point surfaces and yes she has her favorite.  If she is getting a bit cranky, there are times this will turn her back into all smiles.  At this point, she seems to ""chew"" and vigorously suck on the points.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This is a good idea but it takes a lot of pressure for my 7 month old granddaughter to make it vibrate.  I can squeeze one corner to make it vibrate while she chews on the other end.  Otherwise she chews it like a regular teething you.,3
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"The older one of these lasted us several years for my special needs daughter who likes the vibration. This one lasted 3 months before the battery died. Folks, you need to work on battery life or just go back to the old style teether!",1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"A must in addition to all the teething toys. Next to Sophie the giraffe this is his favorite. I. Don\'t really know if the vibration massages. His gums, but he does enjoy biting into it a lot!",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My little guy loves his star teether! It\'s great entertainment for him, and he likes the opposite spinning side too. It was easy to introduce to him, and easy to clean too!",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This product sucks. My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he\'s teething - and he bites down hard. He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate. Very disappointing.,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"The yellow part vibrates once little gums/teeth chomp down on it. easy to hold on to, can easily hook (Via rings or carabiner) to a diaper bag etc. Both my kids loved it while teething.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My son is 4 months old and can not quite get a hang of other teethers. Some of them you have to bend in a specific direction to make the vibration happen. This teether is great. They just bite down (naturally) and the vibration helps with the comfort. I love it!,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This arrived the next day after I bought it and I was very grateful!  We had one other one that my son managed to lose and he was miserable without it!  It really helped soothe his mouth while he was teething!,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I have two of these teethers and both see variable use as my little guy goes through teething spurts.In between, he actually likes sitting or kneeling on the star to get it to vibrate.But as soon as his gums start hurting, he goes straight for this toy.Also, it\'s a smart packaging extra to have the \'free ring\' on top which clearly doubles for hanging purposes.",4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My son is obsessed with this teether!! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it, he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part. I don\'t know what I would do without this one, I think it is a must have! Not only a teether but a toy as well :)",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I bought this for upcoming teething, and we still don\'t seem to be there, but my baby just thinks this thing is good fun.  She bites on it and the vibration cracks her up.  That\'s enough for me!",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My LO is definitely teething and I\'ve tried giving this to her but she can never get the massager to go at it on her own.  I will have to put it in her mouth and press it at the same time.  She looks at me and I imagine her thinking &#34;what the heck is that&#34; and she pulls her face away.  I\'m hoping she\'ll want to use it again before her teeth actually come in since I can\'t return it at this point.  We\'re sticking to the fake keys and her little Sophie the Giraffe for now.,2
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Bought this based on the reviews. My daughter is an early teether at 3 months old. My only complaint is that she has a hard time activating the vibration by biting hard enough. This has allot to do with her age. I have to hold one of the corners for her to activate the vibration. She LOVES it, I only wish it had an on/off switch so I didn\'t have to hold it for her. She actually cries when I try to take it away from her.",4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My baby loves the vibrations on his teeth. He also shakes it like a rattle. This product is good quality.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,I\'ve bought several teethers and this i one of the best ones. The vibration helps ease the discomfort and the colors make it also very interesting.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I know it\'s a safety feature, but it is unfortunate that the batteries are not replaceable in this, because I will probably have to buy another one of these soon, because my little one LOVES this.  He seemed to hate all other teething options out there...even Sophie he had to learn to love (he\'s does like it now), but this he gnaws away on vigorously.The star shaped chewing part is a little big and that worried me a bit when I first got it, but it actually hasn\'t seemed to bother him that much.  So far (he got this at 5 months) he can\'t always make the vibration happen himself but, 1)It\'s not that difficult for me to just push down on it as I\'m holding it for him since I like how it calms him down and 2) even when it doesn\'t vibrate, he still loves to chew away at it.  He has learned over time a bit better about how hard to bite down to make it go too and that it will go by chewing on any of the three available &#34;tips&#34; to the star.He also really likes the little spinning rattle on the end and it has little nibs that he likes to chomp on too (even though it is hard plastic and the star is rubber like).  It is a &#34;substantial&#34;  toy though, so if your little one is in the phase of swinging toys around really hard, they may bonk themselves now and again, but our son seemed relatively un-phased by that.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,I got this for my son when he was about 8 months. he loved bitting it and he carry it all over the house. He is now 18 months and it still works plus he still bits on it too. I found it very easy to clean too.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This thing is big. Baby can grow into it. It really does help when I hold it and turn it on for him. If he isn\'t done with it he is sure to let me know. Which to me translates that he likes it. I\'m not sure how I feel about the sticky feeling plastic, seems unnecessary and everything sticks to it.",4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"If I can recommend one teether to buy for your teething baby, it would be this one. The vibration made it fun and it took the edge off for my little guy. The shape/handle made it really easy for him to hold. We never leave the house without this thing and it is the go-to gift I give to all my expecting friends.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I had bought a similar toy like this in the 90\'s for my daughter when she was teething and now she has children. I bought one for my grandson, then more recently this one for my granddaughter. Babies love the sensation it gives them when their front teeth are coming out and making them miserable. I believe it relieves them of some of their pain and I highly recommend any parent with teething babies to get this toy for them! It is a sturdy product and you don\'t have to worry about any little parts coming loose or damaged. My babies and grandkids abused theirs and it still took the beating.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don\'t know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It\'s a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This is great, my son loves it and it\'s pretty easy for him to hold he enjoys the vibrations when he chews on it.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,A favorite in our house!,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, ""safety tested"" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear ""BPA free"" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn\'t the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I\'m sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I\'m still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused.",2
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"My son has had this teether since he was 3 months old. I thought maybe he\'s just too young & not interested in it(even though he did have 2 teeth already) He is now 8 months old, and still isn\'t very interested in this teether. The reason I bought it was because it was in-expensive and easy for him to hold & pick up. He would rather pick up a toy car, or some sort of stuffed toy, which I understand every child is different. My only big complaint - the star bead on the end. It is hard, and pointy. If it catches my son\'s sore, in-coming teeth the wrong way, he will cry. Other then that, the colors are great, and definitely catch baby\'s eye. Overall, it\'s an OK toy for the price.",3
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"This teething ring is great!  We probably have enough toys to have our own toy store, including at least 2-3 of these teething rings! Our 10-mth-old baby loves to stick one of them in his mouth (like just one bead of it) and walk or crawl around with his hands free to hold other toys.  Our 7-mth-old, loves it too, with his favorite game being to simply have one of us sit it on his head and then wait for it to fall off when he moves.  He thinks it is hestarical.  It\'s amazing how much fun they can have with such a simple toy.",5
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,My daughter loves this and it keeps her happy for a long time.  It is also very easy to wash to keep clean as well.,5
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"My baby loves to play with this during bath time! It\'s easy for her to hold, bite and play with!",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I bought this for my 8 week old daughter, we are planning a trip to Texas and did not want to take the heavy stroller...I tried her in the sling,she got very hot and because of that she got heat rash all over her face and neck (she was only in the sling for about 10 minutes)!!!! I did not like all the padding, it makes it to bulky! On top of all that it gave me a back ache!!If you are serious about a sling I would choose the Maya, it is a thinner material, and is not bulky at all. That is what I ended up buying, and my daughter loves it and so do I.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I thought this would be an excellent item to have. I was wrong! This is the most cumbersome thing I own and my son sweats like crazy in it. There\'s no support for the baby\'s neck or back, and I always feel like he\'s about to fall out of it. Unless you\'ve got really strong shoulders or a feather-weight infant, you might want to skip the infant carrier thing completely. Save yourself time and money on this - I wouldn\'t buy it again!!",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"It is a little awkward at first, but I had an extremely premature baby who was too small for the traditional carriers, and needed to be held all the time.  I lived, cooked, did laundry, ate, and slept with this sling for 2 months.  Once my baby was bigger and needed to be held less I started using other carriers.  But now I\'m back to the sling because quite frankly, once you get the hang of it, its much, much easier to get baby in and out of it.",4
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn\'t liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn\'t give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &quot;training&quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,This is a great product but it is just too big for me. If you are 5\'5&quot; inch. and below please do not get this cause it will look like a sack on you.  My baby was terrified and looked uncomfortable in it. She cried everytime I put her inside. Practice makes perfect but eventually my baby &amp; I got tired of using this.,1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"After reading all the great reviews on the sling I decided to try one.  We both hated it. Maybe because I\'m 5\'1 and my son was eleven pounds when he was born made it more difficult. I kept trying to make it work for us but after 6 months I gave it up. I ended up giving it away. It\'s not one size fits all. If you\'re short, think twice on this.",2
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I used this sling for both of my babies, (0-&gt; 2.5yrs). We had a front backpack style which was good for about 3 months, until the weight of the baby started to make my back ache.The best thing about this sling, besides the fact that the kids loved riding in it, is that it folds up into a reasonably size bundle that fit in my diaper bag. So as the kids aged, and wanted to walk on their own I could just toss this carrier in the diaper bag for when they got tired. Also with the kid riding either in front or on your hip, they are very accessible, so that you can hand them something, like a bottle or a bit of food when you are on the go. (Say like walking around at the Zoo.)I must admit I liked the hip carry position best, it mimic\'s having my arm under their butt, and holds them close.Anyway its reasonably priced, you\'ll get your use out of it, (unlike the front only carriers, which as I mentioned aren\'t good for very long, or the backpack carriers, which while are good for that heavy load, don\'t pack up and so aren\'t with you when you need them.)",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,My Grandson is super fussy and I used this for my own son. Put my Grandson in this turned on the vacuum and he was out like a light! He looked just like he was back in the womb!Thank goodness I still had this as it is no longer available. What a great product!,5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"Every time I hear a parent say that they tried a sling, but baby hated it, or it was a pain, or they just ended up not using it, this was the sling they tried.  People who love their slings used a Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder, or New Native sling.  All of which come in great fabric choices and are easy to use.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I am the the mother of a 14 week old who has reflux and is uncomfortable sleeping in a crib or anywhere flat. She wants to be held *all* the time, and it was getting pretty exhausting in our arms (and my chronic tendonitis was flaring up) until we ordered the sling after reading about it in Dr. Sears\'s The Baby Book.  I had my doubts, but boy has it been a lifesaver!The sling has been invaluable for me, my husband, and our regular sitter. With it, we are able to walk, bounce, give the calming pinky finger treatment, and see what\'s going on with the baby. She started using the sling at 2 weeks, when she was about 7 pounds. It took a few times, but she is now completely comfortable in it and it is a favorite napping spot.As I am large-breasted, I did find it awkward to breastfeed in it, although I\'ve been able to do it successfully a couple of times in public sitting down.  The fabric is soft and easily washable (important for those baby mishaps).  The padding helps me feel comfortable as a bit of protection in case of bumping.  The size is very adjustable for different height people, although you may need to pull through a lot of fabric to bring small babies in tightly, especially if you have a smaller chest size.The NoJo sling would benefit from having some loose fabric at the end to cover the baby\'s head in the sun and provide more coverage during breastfeeding. The stopper piece of plastic at the end of the fabric adds safety (it won\'t pull through), however it can whack the baby if you aren\'t careful when getting it on or off.  It could also use a zippered storage area, a feature of some other slings.  Also, the blue with plaid seems to be the only fabric sold these days, although I have seen other patterns and colors on eBay.  This is fine with jeans, but not great when you have to go to a wedding, as I did with the sling earlier this summer. I think it also makes people think that she\'s a boy, for some reason.  Maybe it\'s the blue and the fact that they can\'t see her cute dresses!The sling is also helpful in keeping interested strangers at a slight distance away from the baby -- they are less able to grab at her, which I think is good from a germ perspective, especially for newborns. When it is very hot or humid out, this sling can be a bit heavy for the baby (especially up against a hot mama!), but on cooler days the fabric adds just the right amount of warmth, like a light blanket.When I was pregnant, I assumed the Baby Bjorn would be all we would need. Instead it hangs on a hook most of the time unless we\'re going for a long walk or shopping -- activities where having two hands is important and you\'ll be doing them for a while. That thing is so hard to get on and off! Plus, you aren\'t supposed to use it until they are 8 lbs. The baby seems to really like the flexibility of positioning with the sling -- especially curling up happily in a womb-like ball -- and sometimes gets irritated by being all dangled out in the Bjorn.Carrying the baby in the sling makes you so much more mobile than using a stroller or lugging her around in her heavy carseat, so I use it whenever I anticipate being in public where they are stairs, space issues, or other impediments.  It\'s good for short shopping trips as well, especially if you\'re with a friend who can carry things or push a cart, both of which are harder to do with the sling on.She\'s also a million times more comfortable in the sling than in her car seat, where she often cries.  Our NoJo Babysling has been in constant use since it arrived, and ties the bouncy seat (where she mostly sleeps by day) as the best return on investment of any of the baby gizmos we bought.  Our sitter will often wear the baby for her entire nap. The sitter just sits (often in a rocking chair or porch swing to provide some more movement) and reads while the baby sleeps.One last thing that\'s great is that when the baby falls asleep, she can be laid down on the bed or bouncy chair and the sling just slips off the wearer without waking the baby.I did not watch the video, but did read the sling chapter in the Baby Book, which was helpful. We have recently started using the kangaroo (facing out) position as the baby loves looking at the outside world now. It\'s nice to have this sort of flexibility.  If you are getting tired carrying around your baby, and would like an extra hand free, a sling is a great investment and while not the most elegant, the NoJo is a good workhorse one to use on a daily basis.",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I love Dr. Sear\'s books, but this baby sling is much too large!  I am a slightly small framed 5\'5"" woman.  My 6\'5"" husband wears this sling just fine.  But, for a sling to work for YOU, it MUST FIT properly!  I finally bought a sling that fit me when my son was over 1 year old.  I couldn\'t believe what a difference it made and felt so sad that I hadn\'t tried a different sling sooner. My son loves sitting in it on my hip and brings it to me whenever I am working in the kitchen. Try the Rosado sling or any other brand that comes in sizes and buy the size that fits your body!  You will really be able to enjoy the baby wearing experience that Dr. Sears recommends so highly!",2
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I think slings are some of the most useful items for babies. They make nursing so easy, even while walking around on the street or in a busy store. I love the Sears Library, so I thought the Sears NoJo sling would be great. While I did use it for a long time, and would still recommend it over a front or back carrier (at least for the first few months), I found that this sling was difficult to adjust and my baby seemed to disappear in the first month or so. For small babies I prefer a sling with no railings, and more adjustable. The New Native sling and many others offer this. I would shop around online, there are many better slings than this.",3
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"We purchased the Babysling when our daughter was 2 weeks old.  I was looking for a baby carrier that I could wear while nursing her that would be comfortable and discreet.  Initially, I found the sling very awkward to use.  I wasn\'t able to master nursing her in the sling until she was 2-3 months old.  However, as a carrier the babysling was great from the beginning.  Our daughter was colicy, and being able to put her in the sling all cozied up to either myself or my husband, hands free, was a God send.  This calmed her 90% of the time.  As the months went by, being able to wear her in the sling enabled me to get housework done without baby crying to be picked up - she was already up, and was able to be &quot;involved&quot; in my daily activities this way.There are many different ways to wear your baby in the sling, and that versatility has made it one of the best baby product purchases we made.  Our daughter is now 2 1/2 (30+ lbs.), and when she\'s having a rough &quot;toddler day&quot; will still occasionally ask for the sling.Be patient with the sling.  Practice with it, and if you can, find a friend who has used one successfully.  Dr. Sears also has a whole chapter on using a sling (any sling, not just this brand) in his book The Baby Book - great photos in there to help get the hang of things.One last remark... I have a friend who tried this sling and was unable to get it tight around her body (she\'s very petite).  There are other brands of slings (Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder) that come in multiple sizes that might allow for a more customized fit.",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"This sling is the third baby carrier I purchased, when the first two highly-promoted products were too uncomfortable.  My son was a premature baby who needed to be carried a lot for the first few months.  After we purchased this sling, my son basically lived in it!  The variety of cozy positions were perfect for his needs, and the sling fits so comfortably on both my husband and me that we don\'t even feel the weight of the baby when he\'s in it.  In fact, the weight of the baby is so evenly distributed that you don\'t develop the shoulder strain or lower back sway that other products gave us.  We would recommend this sling to anyone with a newborn or premature baby, and we continue to use it now that our son is a big 6-month old baby.  Buy it!",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I got a regular carrier as a gift and I hated it! The baby would slide down in it, even though it says its for newborns. I have two other children and had to attend open house at two different schools. The first open house I had the baby in the carrier and it was awful. I ended up taking the baby out of it. My breastfeeding consultant told me about the sling an I went out and brought it right away. It is the best thing I could have ever got for myself and baby. The second open house was so much easier. The baby just bald up like in my womb and slept for the whole two hours. It was also great because I had both hands free to meet and greet the teachers. It comes in handy for breastfeeding discretly in public which for some moms is a must. The baby would sometimes get upset when taken out of the sling. I would recommend the sling to every mom every where!!!!!!",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn\'t get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn\'t seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone\'s advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I\'m petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that\'s not bulky and comes in sizes - I don\'t get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I have four children and have seen the benefits of the sling first-hand in varied situations.  My first was very small, and as a newborn, I thought he seemed lost in the sling so I exchanged it for a front-pack carrier.  Now I know that you can put a blanket or such in the sling to help cradle a newborn more securely.  It was a lost opportunity for us.  With the arrival of my second child, I decided to give it another try, as many of my friends raved about theirs and I\'d need my hands free for my first child still.  I found the sling to be great for nursing, and afforded me privacy when I had to do so while out and about as I could pull the sling\'s fabric right over the baby and cover us both.  For a tired baby, it is much more conducive to sleeping than an upright carrier, and you can slip out of it and lay the baby down while still in the sling, if necessary.  My third child was (and still is) very cuddly, and enjoyed being next to me.  Since a mom\'s arms tire after a while, I found the sling a great way to incorporate baby into my routine without wearing myself out.  My fourth child turned our world upside-down with a very colicky start.  The &quot;insert-in-sling-and-go&quot; method was the only way to settle him down.  I could nurse, cook supper, do whatever I needed to do while keeping him close and moving, which was the key.  He learned to relax and even sleep while I was doing all sorts of things and making quite a racket at times.  Now at nearly three, he\'ll fall asleep while I\'m driving and I can take him into the house, remove his coat and shoes, then carry him upstairs to bed without disturbing him.  I believe his learning to relax and sleep in the sling with so much going on around him has helped him in this area, too.  Most of all, it is just nice to have that close time with your little one in the sling, even if you are busy with other things to do.  I can\'t promise miracles, but this sling has been a crucial part of our early parenting and I recommend it highly!",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I bought this babysling after reading about it in Dr. Sears\' book.  My daughter was 2 months old and fussy!  Nothing seemed to work.  I was desperate!  Since the babysling was adjustable I thought it would fit all body types...not!  I am of average height but on the slimmer side.  It gave me alot of shoulder and back pain.  I rate this a one star because I found one use for it...I use it tied around my torso to carry my daughter on my back with the slight support of my hands. Back carrying is a bit tricky so don\'t try it alone!  I think baby slings are great but not this one is not for me.  If you are slimmer than average, try the New Native baby carrier.  It\'s portable and comes in different sizes.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,I disagree with all of the reviews that say one size does not fit all. My Husbad is 6&quot;4 I am small frame 5&quot;2 and all we had to do when switching was move the adjustment. It was quite easy. We bought this after having the others. But they spread our daughter legs too far and she wanted to lie down at times not sit up. It was great because she could sit or lie down. And when she was very fussy it was the only way to get her to sleep. We then just slipped it off and put her down. IT was Great! Now that she is older I no longer use it but it was such a life saver I could not bring myself to get rid of it.  I not only recomend this but Dr. Sears book to anyone who has a fussy baby.,5
"Arm\'s Reach Co-Sleeper Original Bassinet, Solid Toffee","I love the idea of the co-sleeper. I\'ve seen some other concept designs by other companies and I hope they follow through with them. Arm\'s Reach has a bit of a monopoly on the co-sleepers right now. My little one hasn\'t arrived yet, so I haven\'t actually used it yet. Assembly is REALLY confusing. I don\'t know what happened to my paper instructions, but I can\'t find them. Luckily, there are some on the AR web page. But it is still so confusing.For those of us who are ardent Attachment Parenting, this is ideal. My older son, 15 months old, is still in bed with us and this Arm\'s Reach will give us the extra space for two little ones. We used the Snuggle Nest when our older boy was a small infant and that worked great. With two though, I wanted to keep the older away from the younger while they slept but still near us.If attachment parenting is a new concept for you, I strongly encourage you to read as much as you can online. Arm\'s Reach co-sleeper is a great way to co-sleep without the fear of suffocation.",4

Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"This is a horrible product - because the base of the bar is round, it doesn\'t attach properly to a stroller, and it keeps sliding forward or back, thus losing all the snacks in the cup.  They need to redesign it with a flat base.  There is one company that has one with the flat base - it\'s made by Kids11, Inc -and my daughter LOVES IT!  Don\'t waste your money on this one - you, and your little one will just be frustrated!",1
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"This toy was a waste of my money.  It did not fit on my stroller without some modification and even then, it didn\'t stay put.  It would not stay upright when my daughter played with it.  And it had a removable piece in it.  Needless to say, it was not a piece my daughter at the time knew how to put in and out.  And on top of that, she decided that she\'d rather play with the removable plastic piece than the toy itself!  Also, my stroller would not fold up with this on (oh yea, my stroller is a name brand stroller too).  I would have to remove it everytime i folded it up.  Needless to say, I did that about twice and then tossed the toy in the trash.",1

I had no idea the ladybug on it was a snack holder, I wouldn\'t be putting anything in there, The stroller I have the Tray comes off so I just put the toy on it without the tray. but it the straps do loosen up on it, so I am every once in awhile Straightening it.I do reccomend the toy to anyone who has a baby like my daughter! i\'m very happy with the toy!",5

I give this product 3 stars because my son did like to play with it but, thats really the only good thing.",3
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"I bought this on a whim to keep my 4 month old happy in his stroller.  Otherwise, I would be holding him while pushing the stroller!  Well - he is now 9 1/2 months old and STILL loves it!  He bites on the wings of the bee and chews on the bug attached with fabric.  He doesn\'t ever seem to tire of this toy and I\'ve been on marathon shopping sessions with him lasting a few hours!!  I would recommend this to everyone as one of the must haves for under 12 months!",5
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 months. He is now 11 months and is not that enthused with it anymore. I liked this product because of the bright colors and the variety for him to play with. It is a very good toy, but my son doesn\'t have much interest in it. Nothing at all wrong with the toy, I would recommend it to anyone.",4
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,This toy is very cute and I personally love Sassy products but I found this to be a hazard as well as a waste.  First of all the butterfly hits my children in the face and has hurt their mouth as well not to mention it does not fit properly on a stroller.,1
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"This toy is so nice to have if you use your stroller a lot. My baby has loved playing with this and I have even given this as a gift. The only thing that I did not like was that the cup that is the bugs legs, comes out. That is great for cleaning but if the baby takes it out, it can become yet another thing to keep track of during your ever so busy outings. Overall, this is a great and cute idea and gives some added fun for babies stroller time.",4
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"We have this stroller bar and it ABSOLUTELY fits on the Graco strollers!  We have the Graco Quattro Tour system and this toy bar has been on it since we took my son out of the car seat carrier.  You need to put the velcro on off to the side and then slide it on to the main section of the snack tray.  It takes maybe 1-2 minutes to attach and then you never need to touch it again.  My son loved to look at it when he was 4 months and loves to play with it now that he is one year old.  The only complaint that I have about this toy is that the snack cup bug comes with an insert that is supposed to look like legs when the cup is closed.  It tends to fall out so i just took it off the toy.  Other than that, this is a great product and will occupy your child during long stroller trips.",5
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,Baby loved this but the only problem is the straps that tie it to the stroller are not big enough for some trays. Due to this my first one came un-sewed and I had to buy another one and the same thing happened again.,3
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"Once my daughter started teething, the paint started coming off &amp; it was only when we found some on her lip that we realized.  We have not used it since &amp; had only been using the bar for a couple of months.I worry about such things as \'paint eating\' &amp; consider the possible risks to be too concerning to rate this product any higher than 1*.Best wishes.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Ok - newsflash.  Diapers are just smelly.  We\'ve had this pail for 2.5 years now.  It was our first and primary one.  There were no major smell problems until after one year, when our son started eating solids.  Also, we change the bag twice weekly as 3 days is about the max for smell-containment.  Around 20-22 months we started shopping for a container that would be less smelly and didn\'t find one as good.  (We have a cheaper one upstairs which broke immediately and always stunk!)  We finally just put the Diaper Champ in the attic a few months ago and use the cheap one with the flip-up lid - mainly since the cheapo fits inside the cabinet and we didn\'t notice a big difference in smell-control.  (The most helpful action is to tie the dirty diapers inside a small plastic bag before putting them in the pail.)A couple of our friends have this pail and were pleased until the children started eating solid food and things got stinkier - but that\'s pretty much the consensus according to many reviews on the different pails.  I\'ve knocked off a star since the mechanism isn\'t that intuitive (to grandmothers and babysitters, at least) and it frequently gets stuck when the bag starts getting full.  Plus there are some smell issues, as with any pail.  However, the fact that you can use regular trash bags is so much more convenient!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a good product to start and very easy to use.  But as baby gets older and begins solid foods, it is not effective as an odor controlling pail.  It is simply a place to put dirty diapers.  My daughter is now 10 months old and we had to remove the Diaper Champ from her nursery because it smells too bad.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I selected the Diaper ""Champ"" mainly because you can use ordinary trash bags and not be roped into buying the specialty refill bags, and it was moderately priced (a little less than the Diaper Dekor). It also seemed that the reviews of this product were generally more positive...The positives are:1. You can use any trash bag2. Easy to use and refillThe negatives are:1. The bag doesn\'t seal around the dirty diapers, so when it comes time to refill the bag, it\'s just like opening a regular trash can. Smells like the Champ is trying to knock YOU out with odor!2. The plastic seems to smell, ie. You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ. That ""side"" of the plastic dumper-thingie is in contact with the air inside the dirty diaper changer, so when you flip it over the next time to dispose of another diaper, you smell the last 8 diapers you put in there...pretty gross.3. The ""odor seal"" (some soft material) really seems to retain odor. It cannot be washed or replaced, so after a while, the Diaper ""Champ"" smells even when freshly washed and deodorized (I\'m talking about hosing down outside and scrubbing with Clorox cleanser!). Super-frustrating! This is my primary complaint.Okay, so some things are a given as far as disposal systems go (ie. *some* odor, must empty frequently, must wash and disinfect occasionally), but still I think this product leaves much to be desired.We\'re going to try another disposal system.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Excellent diaper disposal unit.  I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).  I am soooo pleased with this product!!! A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We love our diaper champ.  It is very easy to use just drop the diaper in and flip the top over.  No need to stick your hand inside.  No hint of an odor, even when you are putting another dipaer in.  When it gets full, just put in a new trash bags.  The best feature of all is that even the most curious little ones can\'t get into the diapers.  Before we found the diaper champ, we had another diaper pail and our son learned to open it and pull the diapers out.  That is no longer a problem!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Two girlfriends and two family members put me onto this diaper pail.  They each had tried the Diaper Genie and had horrible results with eventual smells, and costliness of buying proprietary DG cartridges.  My family members eventually started bringing every dirty diaper out to the trash and leaving just wet diapers in the DG, that is until they found out about the Diaper Champ!Wow, what a difference, it seals in orders very well and using normal 8 - 13 gallon trash bags makes it economical.  The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child\'s point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.  Also, it needs to be away from the wall a little bit, so that it\'s flip top access lid locks into place and doesn\'t plop back down, but when engaged, the top will stay open so you can get at the bag of diapers within without having it fall onto your hand.We keep a little can of Oust nearby, spritz it before opening the top, grab the bag at it\'s neck to close off stinky odors, lift it out, twist it at the top and secure it with a twist-tie, and away we go to the garbage can.  And we take antibacterial wipes and run them around in the plunger area on both sides, voila, it\'s clean.At 3 months, we change the bag about 1 - 2 times a week.  Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that\'s better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I waited to review this until I saw how it performed in the really-stinky-diaper stage.  Now, with my daughter at 1 year and eating lots of solids (and making really stinky diapers), I can happily recommend the diaper champ.  A couple suggestions: 1) as baby\'s poop gets stinkier, empty more often (at least once a week) and 2) every time you empty, spray with Lysol or similar product and wipe out with antibacterial cleaner.  This second step has kept the plastic from retaining a bad smell.I gave 4 stars because it\'s not ""perfect"" -- sometimes a little smell leaks out if it\'s very full.  But all around a good product, and not needing special refill bags is a huge benefit for a busy mom.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have had a diaper genie for almost 4 years since my first son was born and I have been using it with my second as well.  I thought I\'d try the champ to save $ on the genie refills.  Well it is not a $ saver because it does not hold the odor inside so I was constantly changing the trash bags.  The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.  The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.  I suppose you could use it as a regular trash can in your child\'s room-they wouldn\'t be able to get into it!  Don\'t waste your $ to ""save"" $!  Buy the genie-your nose will thank you!!  Also, if you don\'t keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it! YUCK!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.  I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn\'t like the idea of having to buy special bags.  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed \'diaper odor.\'  In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son\'s diaper have been amazed at how the very \'potent\' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!  I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.  For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!  Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.  SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn\'t as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.  Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I am so glad I got the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie!  You can use pretty much any plastic bag - even a grocery bag will do in a pinch.  My baby is 6 weeks and I have never smelled any odors at all from the Champ.  I especially like the way you close it - you just flip the handle and that\'s it.  The Champ is definitely the best.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We had 2 diaper Genie\'s both given to us as a gift but it was hard to use it since everytime you stuff the diaper in you have to turn it which cannot be done with one hand (required if you are holding your baby).  Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.  On top of that the refills are very expensive.  So we decided to buy Diaper Champ and so far we love it.  It is very easy to use with one hand.  I like the feature that you can acutally clean the chute if for some reason it gets messy.  Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  It is very easy to use and does not smell unless the bag needs to be replaced and the most important part is that you can use your regular garbage bags (no need for expensive refills).,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"When shopping around for a diaper pail I was drawn to the Diaper Champ for several reasons. 1) I loved the idea of using regular plastic bags from the grocery store. 2) The one-hand chute is quick and easy to use while dealing with a squirming baby. 3) I\'d heard negative reviews about the Diaper Genie. Now that I\'ve had the Diaper Champ for 8 months, I\'m looking for a diaper pail that lives up to its name.About 2 months ago the chute began to stick and the pail began to release unpleasant fumes each time I\'d drop a diaper in. The inner lining had come loose and was preventing diapers from dropping down into the bag. Eventually, the lining just fell out and that\'s when the smell became unbearable. Not only is my daughter\'s nursery filled with odors strong enough to give you a headache, the smell is seeping into the hall and down the stairs.Our Diaper Champ is on its way to the recycle bin. It won\'t be returning for a come-back fight.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the very best. So much better than Diaper Genie. No doubt about it. I would never buy Diaper Genie again. As a matter of fact I threw them out. Here you have No Refills to buy, much easier to empty and put in a new garbage bag, a lot cheaper and most of all a lot quieter. The Diaper Genie is so loud when putting in a diaper in the middle of the night that is a pain. I highly recommend this product. In regards to smell?.....excuse me there are diapers in there, not roses. Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go. If you\'re still picky put in an airfreshner.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought this pail because it used regular trash bags and hoped it lived up to all it says - IT DOES!!  We use the scented trash bags and have had no trouble at all!  (It does get a little smelly when you change the bag, but that is expected)The only thing we don\'t like is the inside lid that holds the bag down. It does not stay up on its own.  So when you change bags it has to be held open with 1 hand-leaving only 1 hand to get the bag out.  It just makes it akward.My husband even recommends it!!  So it has to be good.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"While pregnant with my son I reviewed all the diaper pails and found the diaper champ to be the most reasonable.  I liked the idea of no costly refills and it was only a couple more dollars than the diaper genie.  It was easy to put together, however it is difficult to open and empty.  My son is now 13 months old and the odor is noticeable.  Even the pail itself stinks regardless of how often I scrub it ( I even use scented trash bags).  With dirty diapers you do have to expect some smell, I mean it comes with the territory, however I have to keep an air freshner plugged into the wall to help combat the smell. It worked well for the first few months, but now I end up having to change the bags before they are even half full, which really seems like a waste.  I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have not used this item yet for diapers, but as for my first inspection upon receiving this as a gift...I found that every time I moved the handle at the top, the unit wobbled due to the poor design- large at the top with a small base.  I noticed that some online stores sell a new and improved design that has a larger base at the bottom- I purchased the newer model and no longer have the wobble problem.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Diaper Champ or Diaper Genie? That was my dilemma when registering for gifts before my son was born. Lucky for me, I had my Mom with me. She runs a daycare and said Diaper Champ is the best by far and that\'s what I went with. The fact that you can use regular trash bags instead of special cartridges was very appealing to me. Now my son is 6 months old and I must say this thing is GREAT! The only time I catch any smell at all is when I change trash bags. I use those Glad trash bags that are scented to prevent odors and that makes a difference, too. it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it. The only thing you need to watch is the opening latch is a bit tricky (I broke a nail the first time I used it, but then I got the hang of it). I am glad for this, though, because if it\'s not easy for me to open, it won\'t be for my son, either.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!) and it even takes the same bags as my kitchen trash can, shich is super convenient, and cost efficient as I can buy them in bulk.The only reason for not rating it a 5 star was that I did have one small problem with it. The foam gasket in the barrell which keeps the poopy smell inside the unit ripped somehow, and it got VERY stinky. HOWEVER, I contacted the manufacturer though their website, and received an email back the same day stating that this was unusual, and that replacement gaskets were on their way to me. They arrived inside of a week and after replacing, it works great again! (They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Although I had a Diaper Genie from my first child, which I hated, I registered for this for my second.  I received very few items from my registry but this was by far the best gift I received overall. It is very easy to operate.  My 4 year old feels a part of the diaper changes because he can work it.  It keeps the smell out which makes mom and dad happy.  But, by far the best thing about the Diaper Champ is that it takes regular trash bags so you don\'t have to worry if [the store] will have the refills.  It is definately a people pleaser!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Granted our 3-month old isn\'t producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.  My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We loved this pail at first. The mechanism seemed ingenius, and we appreciated that it took regular bags. But once our daughter started to stand up, that big white handle was irresistable to her, and before we even realized it, she started flipping it. That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you\'ll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers. Worse yet, they can slam a finger then hurt it seriously in their attempts to get it free by pushing the handle the wrong way. It\'s really pretty scary.You\'ll notice that the positive reviews here generally say ""I\'ve been using this for two months, and it\'s great!"" But once you have older babies, I\'d retire it pronto.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I bought this for my church nursery room. At home we use the First years product, which isn\'t bad but not as good as this one.There are a couple of occasions that dirty diapers were left in it for a week but i didn\'t know because it didn\'t smell till I opened it to change the garbage bag.I think this is the only diaper pail that is cheap to use yet does the job well.Highly recommend.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I recently gave birth to my third child.  When I had my 1st 11 years ago, I got a Diaper Genie and it worked okay, but the stupid refills for it were so expensive that I soon gave up on it.  Not to mention that the ""sausage links"" of diapers it created were pretty gross and I still had to use a garbage bag to dispose of them.  With this baby, I decided to give the Diaper Champ a try.  I LOVE IT!  In fact, I am considering buying one for my church\'s nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.  I agree with any reviews that suggest using scented garbage bags, as it DOES smell pretty awful when you empty it, and I think the scented bags would help that a little.  So far I have had only a minor complaint, and that is that it can be a little tricky to open sometimes, but overall it\'s still a great product.  I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Our daughter is 13 months old and we\'ve been using the Diaper Champ ever since she was born. I highly recommend it because it\'s a great value.  However, there are a few things to be aware of which is why I only gave 4 stars.1. Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC. My husband learned the hard way that the grips get stuck on the seal and the diaper won\'t drop into the bag.  Then you have to pull the diaper out and the grips slowly pull away the seal.  It didn\'t seem to affect the odor control, but it did make it difficult to move the handle/shoot back and forth.  The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2. The unit is top heavy when it\'s empty. I learned this one the hard way.  When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.  Ouch!!3. No, the stink isn\'t completely trapped, but it\'s pretty darn close! The stinkiest part is emptying a full bag.  I found that putting a stick-up inside the lid has made it much more tolerable.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband & I had received a tip from another parent that this was the must have item.  I had always hated that the diaper genie had to have special bags, I was just going to get a regular garbage pail & use that.  That is until we heard about the Diaper Champ.I absolutely love it.  It is a complete life saver all around.  No special bags to buy, not a hassle to put together.  Comes almost all the way assembled out of box just attach to base & voila you are ready to start changing diapers.  A little tip to keep the odor down.  I wipe it out with antibacterial wipes a couple of times a wk, & I spray Lysol disinfecting spray.  Once a month I wash it out with a mild dishwashing detergent.  Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.  It is a sure winner.  You\'ll save a lot of money by using this one.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I don\'t know how we survived the first year without the Diaper Champ.  My daughter is now 13 1/2 months old and we still have an odor free nursery.  It\'s very economical, too.  Using regular kitchen bags and holding more diapers than the competing diaper disposal system makes this quite efficient.A trick that was passed down to me from an experienced mom to control odor (again, yes, it\'s going to smell a little...you put stinky diapers in it!):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.  I don\'t know why the dryer sheet works...but it does!  And if I don\'t change it out regularly (about once every few weeks) then I start to notice the smell.Recommended above all other diaper pails!  Price-wise the Diaper Champ just can\'t be beat.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We originally had the diaper genie which we found to be a pain after the top broke off twice and all those replacement specialty bags we had to buy were getting expensive but not controlling the odors.  All that sausage shaped smelly garbage eeeewwww had to be put in another garbage bag just to get it out of the house!  My sis-in law had the diaper champ & I couldn\'t believe she even had any dirty diapers around...there was no smell!  We chucked the genie and bought the champ. It was so much easier to use...just roll the diaper into a little ball and drop into the hole on top, flip the handle and bye bye smelly diaper (my 16 month old can do it) And there were no special bags to buy, just the same regular garbage bags we used already in the kitchen. Experienced parents will understand and appreciate that it comes apart for easier cleaning for those times when it may become a mess.  We had a problem with odors after about a year of use so I called BabyTrend to see what they recommended.  They sent me these replacement sponge gaskets (free of charge) and we were once again odor free. Now on my 3rd child and almost 3 years later, I just called them again to get another set of replacement gaskets (again free of charge) they will be here in about a week.  THIS IS A GREAT ITEM and the company stands behind their product (even years later!)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I didn\'t want to get the Diaper Genie because of the expensive refills needed to use the product.  The Diaper Champ uses 10 or 13 gallon trash bags (or you can recycle larger store bags to use in the Champ).  The mechanism doesn\'t let odors out and if you have toddlers that get into everything, they can\'t get into the Diaper Champ!  Opening the Diaper Champ is easy but could be an initial challenge for some but once you figure it out it\'s simple to open.  I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I wasn\'t sure which to get between this and the Diaper Genie. I am so glad that I chose this one. I love that I can buy the scented bags of my choice. It really holds in the horrible diaper smell. I love it and wouldn\'t trade it in for anything.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I chose the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie because of its money-saving feature of being able to accomodate most plastic bags with handles.  (The Genie requires use of their own bags.)  The plastic bags that work best are the larger kinds like the ones you get from Toys R Us or Ikea.  The plastic supermarket bags are a little too small.In regards to odor control, the DC has been successful for 3/4 of the year.  There is a noticeable smell during the summertime, so I\'ve had to change the bags more frequently on hot days or else face the consequence of suffering the aroma of baking poop.My only negative comment about this product is concerning the lid.  For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.  Even though I have short, uncared for nails, I\'ve had a few bent nails from trying to pull open the lid.  Then, the next problem is that the lid doesn\'t open all the way (like a cigarette lighter).  It opens up to about a 75 degree angle.  This makes it inconvenient when you are trying to remove a stuffed bag of diapers.  Also, the underside of the lid has several plastic sharp juttings against which my hands would occasionally get scratched.  And, during the removal of the full bag, this is when you get the full blast of your little one\'s excretions (quite possibly 3-5 days worth of them), so hold your breath!Although there is room for improvement on this design, I haven\'t seen or heard of any other model that can do this job nearly as well for as reasonable a price.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Bad construction is my main issue. My husband assembled it and when changing the bag, you\'re supposed to open up the top head part which tilts back.  There\'s a little plastic tab that\'s suppused to slide in as your opening the top, but instead it get\'s cought so it allows the top to open up only partially. It may just be one defective item that somehow passed the quality control inspection, but I\'ve given up on diaper pails in general.  Talking to 1st time parents, I found out that almost everyone gets one, but almost everyone stops using them very quickly.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was very happy with the Diaper Champ for a long time. I loved being able to use regular garbage bags, changing the bags was easy, and easy to empty. Very simple to put the diapers in. We did have to replace the sponge ""gaskets"" twice before putting the Diaper Champ to the curb. Once our child was on table foods this diaper pail does not work anymore! Even with cleaning it and letting it air out for a day. It literally made the whole house stink!So out to the curb it went and got something else. There is absolutely no smell w/ the different diaper pail.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is on my list of must haves.  The thing has been in my bedroom for 6 months.  Not once have I ever smelled an odor from this thing.  I love that I can use any kind of bag so I just buy those super cheap super flimsy tall size garbage bags.The only drawback, as with all diaper pails, is that as the baby gets bigger and the diapers get bigger, you have to change the bag more often.  Our baby is 6 months and we fill it about once every 36 hours.But still, I wouldn\'t trade it for the world.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Diaper catches and jams in the well and that is particularly nasty when the diaper is dirty.  Also, it is impossible to get it 100% clean after such a jam, which causes the oder to persist.  I have given up and am now throwing my Diaper Champ away and getting something new.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the convenience of not having to buy special bags.  I got my Diaper Champ as a hand-me-down from a relative, and it still works great.  There is no diaper odor in our nursery.  When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn\'t flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it\'s overflowing!).If you don\'t clean things, they don\'t smell clean.  This isn\'t rocket science.The only reason I\'m not giving it five stars is because I don\'t like the opening mechanism on the front.  But I can\'t think of any way they could\'ve done it differently that would be as effective.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'ve been using this diaper pail for 2 and 1/2 years and I LOVE it.  I can buy inexpensive scented bags from the grocery store and I just use recycled grocery bags to wrap-up the poopie ones.  My son\'s room has NEVER smelled at all!I do lysol it every once in a while.  But that\'s all I\'ve had to do.When I\'m at friends\' houses that have the diaper genie, I\'ve been confused about how to use it.  No one has ever been confused about how to use ours.  Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It suprises me to read all of these reviews saying that the diaper pail stinks up a room!  DUH! It\'s full of dirty diapers.  Personally, we never had that problem too much.  The nursery smells a bit sometimes but I think you would have that with every diaper pail.We got this one because we use cloth diapers and don\'t want each one mummified in it\'s own cocoon.  I used this for my first two kids.  We threw it out when we moved but now that the third is here we are going to get a new Diaper Champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Diaper Champ is great.  But just to let you know that I\'ve been breastfeeding and the poop doesn\'t stink as much as formula poop.  So I can\'t tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it\'s excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for the Diaper Champ after seeing the reviews and I cannot talk enough about it. I just live it!!! It is odorless(so far) and very easy to use - and only with one hand, so you can SAFELY keep the other one on your baby. It\'s very easy to change the bags, which you can use any 13 gallons one - no expensive refills to buy!!!! I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,You really can not appreciate this device until you\'ve used it.No smell unless you don\'t empty it for a week or more. An airtight vault it\'s not....but it does what it\'s designed to do very well.Who doesn\'t take out the trash more than once a week ? Same concept with this diaper pail.- From a Dad of a Newborn who\'s thankful he ignored the negative reviews.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am glad my friend told me about the diaper champ, because otherwise I would have gone in for the diaper genie. This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor. It is also bigger than the genie, and the best part is, you can use regular garbage bags in them. Isn\'t that just PERFECT? Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"In reading some of the other reviews, I think it\'s all been said but I guess I\'ll say it again anyway.  :)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.  My husband and I tend to let it get to the point that we have to actually push the plunger down to get the diaper to go in and still the nursery is odor-free for playing or sleeping.  And I must admit, I have a 1 yr. old who eats everything under the sun and even when it comes time to change the bag, it\'s not that bad.  Tie it up fast and you\'re good to go. ;)  I will admit that it can be hard to open, but if it were easier, I\'d have dirty diapers strung from one end of the room to the other because of my busy boy!!!  I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I Loved this product. It kept smell to a minimum and could use a regular size trash bag.  Highly  recommend.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After 2 and half years I still can\'t get the smell out. Its been sitting outside airing out for 3 months now, I think thats where I\'m leaving it too. I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This product meets all my expectations. The diaper champ is easy to put together. It keeps odors in the container. Most importantly it uses regular 13 gallon bags! By the way, keep a roll of these at the bottom of the container for that day when it fills up.  Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the worst diaper pail ever!  It was great for the first couple weeks, but then it began to smell.  I cleaned the inside and outside with 409 again and again, but the smell would return with the first diaper I put in.  Then to make matters worse my 16 month old figured out it was fun to put toys in the hole where you put the diapers and try to flip it the way I did with his dirty diapers.  I had a Diaper Genie that broke and was hopeful that this less complicated diaper disposal system would work as well, but it does not!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I purchased this pail about a year ago and found out right away that it will not control Ordor for #2 diapers.  My cat box smells fresher!  So, I used it for wet diapers only until I found that my now 1 1/2 year old son makes is own deposits...his toys!  Oh and by the time the pail fills up with wet diapers, those smell too.  The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don\'t have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.  So, the pail is now in our storage unit and we have a wicker basket with a lid (found free at a garage sale) lined with a garbage bag that sits on our deck right outside the sliding glass door. Diaper deposits are made there where it is easy to get too, the smell is outside and it can be emptied by my husband...outside!",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is my first baby so I have nothing to compare this product to. But I have heard horror stories of stinky diaper pails. My baby is now six months old and the only time I smell her diapers is when I change them and when I open the pail to replace the bag! I use the same garbage bags that I use in my 13-gallon kitchen trash can! It\'s so simple and user-friendly it\'s ridiculous! Put in a trash bag, old plastic grocery bag, yard waste bag, whatever; put down the top, you\'re ready to go. The top acts like a chute and whisks the dirty diaper away. When full pop the top (hold your breath), pull out the bag and put in a new one. No jamming or any other kind of technical difficulty whatsoever! And, again, no leaking smells. Don\'t waste your money on anything else!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"As new parents, we started out with the Diaper Genie because everyone told us that we just *HAD* to have one.  While the Genie did a decent job at keeping the odors inside (except when emptying it!), it was a pain in the neck for older family members to use (e.g. grandparents) and those refill cartridges start to add up after a while!A friend with a child the same age as mine showed me her Diaper Champ and I was thoroughly impressed!  Not only did it do a comparable job at keeping odors inside, it was extremely easy to use and did not require me to spend an additional [$$$] each month on refills.  We decided to go ahead and buy a Diaper Champ because our son was only 13 months old and we figured he\'d be in diapers for at least another year so we\'d be saving money after 6 months by not having to buy the refill cartridges.  Then when our twins were born, we were so glad that we had the Champ!  After all, we\'re already buying tons of diapers, who needs to spend another [$$$] a month on those Genie cartridges?!As for ease of use, my 3.5-year-old son loves throwing the dirty diapers away for me because all you have to do is drop it into the chamber and flip the lid.  It is super easy to empty it too.  And I\'ve found that if I use scented garbage bags and give the inside a quick spray with Lysol each time I empty it, the smell when emptying it is not as bad as it is with the Genie.I HIGHLY recommend the Diaper Champ!  And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you\'ll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I found this pail to be heavy without anything in it.  I found that it took up too much space.  I find myself using a regular small garbage pail and I don\'t smell any odors (and all of my windows are closed).  dislike the mechanism for opening this pail, when I opened this pail for the first time, I broke two of my nails, I tried opening again and it was still hard on the fingers and nails. My son is only two months and perhaps I need a diaper pail later on, but for right now, I am going to use a regular garbage pail.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Can\'t get the smell of rank diapers out of the top(cover) of the Diaper Champ. Any better models out there?,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I love the Diaper Champ. It holds a nice amount of diapers,contains the odor and it uses your own garbage bags. The Diaper Champ is easy to use and to empty, it really is a wonderfully designed product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We originally registered and received the safety 1st pail- what a disappointment.  the latch never worked- we purchased this pail and what a wonder!  my busy toddler can\'t get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).  I have recommended this pail to all my friends and they love it as well!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I was told not to waste my money on a diaper pail because it didn\'t do what it claimed to do.  Finding out it was a genie diaper pail I read the reviews of the diaper champ and decided to try the champ.  I couldn\'t have spent my money any wiser. Their is never an odor and I always wait until it is completely full.  Convenience of not buying new bags is wonderful!!  This is great for my 10 week baby\'s room-Love it!!!!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"With my second child I wanted something better than the Diaper Genie which I did not like at all, it was smelly and impossible to do with a one hand action.  Enter the Diaper Champ! After reading all of the customer reviews here I decided to try it and everyone was so right.  I can put poopie diapers in this diaper pail and it doesn\'t smell at all! It holds a sufficient amount of diapers and needs no special bags, just regular garbage bags. I has an easy one hand action to deposit the dirty diapers leaving one hand free to hold the baby with. I am totally pleased with the Diaper Champ and hope everyone gives it a try, its worth the money!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Let me just say, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  I used the diaper genie from the time my daughter was born until the time she was 16 months.  That was all I could take.  Constantly buying expensive refills, emptying it every couple of days, juggling a wiggly baby while trying to open, lift, push, spin, and close the genie was just too much.  Then I was shopping at Babies R Us and in the STORE\'s changing room is the Diaper Champ.  It was easy, didn\'t smell, and used regular trash bags.  I was sold.After using the Diaper Champ for 2 months now, I am confident I made the right choice.  Yes, when it gets too full, you have to change the bag or the weight will get stuck (duh!).  Yes, if you don\'t wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).  Yes, poop does smell (not like roses), but my daughter\'s room doesn\'t smell like poop because the Diaper Champ does a great job of containing odor.  You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.  It is fantastic!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is amazing! We can toss tons of diapers (abouth 5 days diapers for a new born). And there is NO smell at all. I do recommend the following: Close well each diaper with the velcro, you\'ll be able to fit more diappers. And occasionally clean the tube where the diaper is toss with baby wipes, then toss the wipe. Somehow when you open the diaper champ to replace teh bag, you smell more wipes than stools!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We wanted to have a convenient locking receptable for poop-laden diapers in our toddler\'s bedroom. While they do lock, they aren\'t convenient. Wipes get caught in the mechanism and you have to shake and bang it while trying to keep wriggling baby on the changing table. Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often. They\'re bigger than diaper genies, yes, but not quite big enough for a baby with a big appetite.This smearing problem, is, in my opinion, probably the source of the smell that others complain of. We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum. What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch. You\'d need to open the latch before starting the change, and close it after, but that seems easier to me than thumping and wiggling a diaper champ in the middle of the change. It will control odors better, and you won\'t have to be continually wiping poop off the outside of it.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I wasn\'t interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!  Plus they can get expensive when you\'re having to change your baby 8 times a day and you have to buy refills for it.  When I first saw the Diaper Champ and read what you needed for it and what it did, there was no question that I wanted it!  It\'s awesome!  When they say it\'s odorless, it REALLY is.  The only time you ever smell anything is when you open the lid to empty it and all the dirty diapers are right there.  You never smell anything when it\'s closed.  Plus, I like the fact that you don\'t have to buy refill bags for it.  It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.  I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a very convenient and odorless diaper pail!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I checked out all of the available diaper disposal systems.  This by far is the best, no refillable special bags, no stink, and very easy to use.  It is great! Those exploding diapers for newborns can\'t even crack this.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This diaper pail has NO ODOR and is the perfect size.  I use normal 10-gallon trash bags from Target.  No complaints at all!  Very easy to use and seriously, you do not smell any poopy diapers!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the diaper champ for how many diapers it holds and the fact you don\'t have to buy special bags for it, but it doesn not keep in the odors. I feel like I have to change the bag more often so I don\'t know how much I\'m really saving by not buying the special bags that a diaper genie requires. I spray the pail after every use and have cleaned it out with bleach and it still smells. Great idea but it just doesn\'t work. I haven\'t gone back to the diaper genie yet...is there anything else out there that works?",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was definately excited to have a diaper pail capable of keeping smells down and holding more diapers. I have two little ones under the age of two.  I was immediately disapointed to find that everytime I tried to filp the diaper into the pail, in the entire thing opened up.  I guess mine could be broken but I think its just poor design.  It also seems to be no better than the competitors at keeping diaper smells in the pail.  The plus is that it uses regular trash bags.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I own both the Diaper Champ and the &quot;other one&quot;.  I have had the &quot;other one&quot; for two years now and cannot wait to get my toddler out of diapers so I can get rid if it.  I bought the Diaper Champ for my newborn and have had for 2 months and LOVE IT!  Easy to use, easy to clean, and I use tall kitchen garbage bags so emptying it is a breeze!  I wipe it out with Lysol Wipes everytime I change the bag and spray the openings with Lysol once a day and have zero odor problems.  Hint: I also put a dryer sheet at the bottom of the pail in the bag so it gets tossed every time I change the bag and a fresh one gets put in!  Enjoy this product - Wish I had known about it with my first child!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is absolutely, by far, the best diaper pail money can buy.  Never do we detect a diaper odor (and my husband has a very sensitive sense of smell and is usually very quick to complain about such things).  For those who say they have a problem with the Diaper Champ getting stuck...the ONLY time this ever happens to us is when the bag is full and needs to be changed.  We love that it uses regular kitchen trash bags, makes it much more economical.  We have not found that we need to worry about frequent emptying or cleaning.  We just leave the Champ to do its job until the mechanism begins to feel like it\'s getting stuck...then we change the bag.  For us this means about once a week.  Not only is the Champ EASY to use, it\'s kind of fun.  Before our daughter was born we really worried about whether the diaper pail we chose would be effective enough for us because my husband is so sensitive to smells.  But she\'s two months old now and we still just can\'t say enough good things about it.UPDATE:  My daughter is now 9 months old and we STILL love our Diaper Champ.  She\'s eating solid foods, diapers are smellier, but the Champ is still doing it\'s job.  We empty once a week and spray with Lysol.  Yes, there is an odor when changing the bag, but we take the bag directly out to the trash, spray Champ with Lysol, insert new bag and close the thing back up.  Everything is just fine after that.  We are so glad we have the Diaper Champ and cannot sing its praises enough.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"At only 3 weeks old, my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day.  We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it\'s been great so far.  (We\'ll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky!)  It\'s so easy to use and you don\'t have to buy the special bags.  We\'ve used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.  One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag.  Overall, I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We\'ve been using the Diaper Champ for about 4 months now, and have had NO problems whatsoever!  The design is absolutely ingenious and the fact that it takes regular trash bags is a definite plus!  We bought a box of Hefty Trash Bags with that odor patch to use in the Champ and we change the bag about 2-3 times a week, and we\'ve have had no problems with smell.  I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag, but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water, and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out.  So, I called Baby Trend (Diaper Champ manufacturer) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings (which I didn\'t even ask for) for FREE!  The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out, usually after about 6 months.  Overall, I am very pleased with our purchase.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did...dirty diapes and soaked diapers.....I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag. No need for deodorizers.I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty...even did while daughter sleep and no noise! I use the scented bags and even if I don\'t no smell! This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Thank goodness we found something better and easier than ""genie""!!This one works great, no difficulty loading bags or putting diapers in.Only reason for not 5 stars is a little odor escapes but in my opinion well worth the offsetting ease of use.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.  It is ultra convient when you have your hands full with a dirty diaper and a kicking, squirming wiggle worm.  There has been no smell at all, and the champ\'s generous size allows plenty of diapers, which is important because it seems as though there is no time to do ANYTHING!!!  I would recomend this product to any and all people with babies.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I changed my registry from the Diaper Genie to the Diaper Champ after reading the reviews for the Diaper Champ online. I\'m very happy with it. Our baby\'s cradle is in our room so we keep the Champ in there with us. There are no odor problems whatsoever. I also love that you don\'t have to buy specialty bags for this pail.The only caution I give is to moms with long natural or fake nails...the opening latch doesn\'t release very smoothly. When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply. I have short nails but I can imagine long nails might get broken or fake ones snapped off if care isn\'t taken when opening the top.Also, the diaper disposal mechanism, which is great (!!!) since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you\'re trying to get baby back to sleep. Just be sure to dispose of your diaper(s) before putting baby down to sleep.I would recommend this product to everyone, even with these two very minor issues.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I started off with the Genie but quickly realized that I had to keep buying the special, pricey Genie bags. The Champ is great, takes any appropriate sized plastic bag and contains stinky diaper smells well. A MUST have!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"you can use any ol\' bag with this. go to the dollar store and get some of those kitchen bags. they fit it perfectly. you put the diaper in the hold in the top, turn the handle, and pop. byebye poopy diaper! it can hold quite a few. we only need to change the bag once a week. it really does hide the smell. the diaper champ is the best!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It works ok.  I\'ve had it for a few months - I bought it based on its positive reviews in baby bargains, but I\'m going to find something else.  The biggest drawback is that a couple days after emptying it, stuff starts getting stuck in the device so that you have to open it up and wrench poopy wet wipes unstuck...defeats the purpose of an airtight bin.I haven\'t compared it with other bins, so I couldn\'t say whether it\'s the lesser of evils, but hopefully there\'s something better out there for the job.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have been using our Diaper Champ for 4 weeks now (trust me, newborns poopy diapers DO smell) and it has met all our expectations. No odor and easy to use!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"So far so good.  I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.  I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?  Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.  I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I chose the Diaper Champ because you are able to use standard trash bags.  I hate to buy replacement items such as bags ( i usually forget).  I works great.  The only thing is when it is full it is full.  It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.  I have not noticed any lingering oder in the baby\'s room and would recommend this item.,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Overrated, odor is bad. I changed to Gallon zip-locs, you can stuff a few diapers in a gallon zip loc and discard.  If you don\'t want the diaper smell don\'t get this.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'ve never even had a problem with it.  There is no odor and I find it very convenient to use garbage bags.  The only thing I do is spray the inside with lysol once in a while.  Even when I change the bag, the only smell is the diapers.  Once they are out, the diaper champ really doesn\'t have a smell.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have purchased three diaper pails prior to this one. This one is a hundred times better. The other ones always had springs that broke or the lid wouldn\'t stay shut. The Diaper Champ has none of these problems, and it is nice to use regular garbage bags. It was a little more expensive, but well worth the extra money.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ was a great invention. No special bags and easy to use one handed. You just put in regular garbage bags (fits like a glove) and empty as you would your regular garbage. NO smells, NO Mess, NO problem. It\'s a must have!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the only diaper pail we\'ve had and our son is now 2.  We use scented kitchen trash bags ($3-4 for a huge roll at Target) and that seems to improve it\'s olfactory-blunting performance even more.  For especially messy and stinky diapers, I\'ll pre-bag the whole bundle in a small scented bag ($1 for 100 at Dollar Tree) that I can rest in the opening of the Champ.This may seem like a lot of bother, but it\'s not!  I haven\'t even washed the Diaper Champ out or Lysol\'d it in 2 years.  Did I really just admit that?!?  We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.  If there\'s ever a smell in the nursery, it\'s from the dipaer\'s presence pre-Diaper Champ entry.I do wish the Diaper Champ people could find a way to have some button the parent can push to flip the handle while keeping the 1 hand operation.  My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we\'ve had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).  Some simple child-proof mechanism would be a Godsend.Even with that said,  the Diaper Champ is a great product and I\'d recommend it to anyone!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Works great - no smells.  LOVE that it uses regular garbage bags. Easy to change and keep clean. Great option instead of the Diaper Genie that requires special bags and is so wasteful since it wraps each diaper in plastic.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We got the Diaper Champ as a gift and immediately fell in love with it.  I wish I had invented this product.  It is one of our Top 10 items to buy.It takes regular kitchen trash bags and is really quite good about the smell.  Now that we are introducing Isabella to more foods we are finding that it does not contain the smell as well, but better than anything else that we use.The only problem I run into this that it gets stuck on the inside from time to time at the worst possible moment -- stinky full diaper that needs to disappear right now!  I am pregnant again so these smells get to me.  Because of this problem I gave it 4 stars.It gets stuck from an occasional diaper sticky tab sticking to the inside .  When this happens, you have open everything up and it can get a little messy if the tab was stuck in the wrong placeWe also own a Diaper Genie which is 99% smell proof, but also has it\'s own problems.  I would only buy this one, even if money, space and smell were not an issue.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Like other reviewers, I put this diaper pail on my registry because I just didn\'t want the hassle of having to buy special bags--what happens when you run out in the middle of the night!  I liked the fact that you can use regular bags in this diaper pail... in fact I frequently recycle BabiesRUs bags by using them in the Diaper CHamp.  I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I\'ve never had a problem with smell (I\'ve been using it for two+ months now).  You just put the diaper in the hole... flip the lid and the counterweight pushes the diaper down into the bag underneath and its ready for the next diaper--then you flip it back.  The flip handle does get stuck sometimes... but only when it\'s TIME TO EMPTY THE PAIL!!!!  Some reviewers seem to think the pail should empty itself, but unfortunately nothing on the market will do that for you.  When you change the bag (which is incredibly easy to do) you can just spray the inside with a little lysol and then periodically wipe it out with a sponge and some bleach.  I\'d do that much even with the more expensive diaper pails and I\'d still have to buy expensive special bags.... You can\'t expect something that contains poop to smell like a rose or to be germ free without a little work on your part, but with the Diaper Champ you can have a smell-free nursery AND save money by using plain ordinary garbage bags (or recycled plastic bags!)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a two month old.  I\'ve tried both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie for two months now.Bottom line:If cost is important to you...get the Diaper ChampIf smell is important to you...get the Diaper GenieThe design of the Diaper Champ does not prevent smell as well as the Diaper Genie PERIOD.If you see a review here that touts that the Diaper Champ doesn\'t smell, then laugh at them.  They probably have a dog and think that it and their house don\'t smell because of the dog either.YES, the Diaper Genie costs more over the life because of their bags.  SO WHAT.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"When our daughter was born we bought the diaper genie and it soon became another unused thing in our closet.  I found it so impractical, because no matter what it says it is never truely one hand operable.  And it takes so long to stuff and twist that the baby is neglected on the changing table for a longer period of time.  Also, it didn\'t hold very many diapers and was a pain to unload.  I would rather just walk each diaper outside!  So when we were pregnant with our son I told my husband that we had to go shopping for a new diaper pail and that\'s when we found the diaper champ.  I now give this at every baby shower I go to even if the mom-to-be has registered for the diaper genie!  I know she will convert to this one.  I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.  All you do is flip the handle over and you\'re done.  No need to push the diaper in with your hand (gross!) just let gravity do it\'s thing.  It is also very easy to unload and install a new bag.  Plus there are no special bags!  Not only a money saver, but no need to worry about running out.  I just use our kitchen trash bags, and they work great.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After the first 6 months I would have been rating this diaper pail top of the heap.  Certainly not having to buy special bags is a HUGE advantage... and the hole is larger that the genie so you don\'t have to worry about the &quot;squish&quot; factor as much.The problem, and the reason others had a smell problem is that this pail has large foam washers and a foam pad in the top section that get rank after time.  Luckily we just called the company and they sent new ones and the smell went when they did, but it was a bit of a pain.  I still think it was worth it to buy this one!",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have used my Diaper Champ for a little over a year.  I was taken in by the fact that I could use grocery bags instead of continually purchasing liner refills.  The Champ worked great for only a small while.  As your children grow, the Champ will be very little help in controlling odor, which is the sole reason I purchased a diaper pail instead of a garbage can.  I change the pail every two days, sometimes every day due to the odors it fails to control.  I have begun to individually wrap up each smelly diaper before putting it into the diaper pail.  Otherwise, my son\'s room would constantly smell.  I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.  Consider the Diaper Dekor or Neat Disposal System instead.  I\'ve read great reviews on both.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Simply put, the Diaper Champ is much easier to use, less expensive, and most importantly, MUCH better at keeping those odors locked away when compared to the Diaper Genie.  Even the smell of my niece\'s ""soy diapers"" don\'t seep through this.  I have been thoroughly impressed -- even the nurses at the hospital where I had my baby recommended it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love my Diaper Champ. My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it. It\'s simple to use and is cost efficient. The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want. As far as some people saying it smells, I haven\'t had a problem. Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away. I highly recommed this product if you want a clean, simple, and convenient diaper pail!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I agree it\'s better than the genie.  I own the genie and served us well.  But when I had the chance to use this product at Babies R Us store, I was so impressed.  It\'s very easy to use, and it seals out the odor as well.  I wanted to get this for our use, but my genie is still in good use.  Too bad, the champ came late, or we should have gotten this instead.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the diaper champ.  I registered for this item because I liked the fact that it takes regular garbage bags.  When it\'s almost full it tends to have a bit of an odor, but lysol takes care of that, and helps kill germs.  This is very easy to use and is simple to change.  I highly recommend the diaper champ.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This contains the smell and it uses regular bags which makes it the best product in its category.  However, I never use it.  It\'s so much easier just to throw the soiled diaper in a regular garbage bag and take the trash out often.  We take ours out daily - this product tends to make you lazy and by the time you fill it - YUCK!Save your money and just throw your diapers in the trash.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought this because we needed a first floor diaper pail.  And the Diaper Genie was a bit hard to use, so we tried this one.  While this is very easy to use (one-handed), after 36-48 hours, it smells really bad!!  So we have to change the bag in it very frequently.  Oh well, I\'d still recommend it.  You just may have to buy stock in air fresheners as well.  And we even bag our smelly diapers before putting them in.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,love it because it uses the bags from the grocery store.  way cheaper than others.  have to change regulary (2 times per week) when the baby gets on solids though.,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for the Diaper Champ after reading many reviews for several different diaper pails.  This is by far the easiest product to use.  There are no complicated bag systems and no special replacement bags.  I have not had the problem of having any oppressive odors leak out into the room.  The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.  There is no such thing as a completely odorless plastic diaper pail since plastic absorbs odors, but just drop a couple of dryer sheets (Bounce or something similar) into the bottom of the diaper champ (not in the bag) and the odor disappears.  This product is easy to use and the bags aren\'t hard to change.  I would recommend this to anyone.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,My 8 year old yellow lab was able to get the top of the diaper champ off and get his head stuck in the canistar.  No one was home and he suffocated.  This could just as easily have happend to a small child.  There is no warning in the literature to prevent this type of horrible tragedy .,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I have no problems with my Diaper Champ.  It\'s great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.  Definitely recommend,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We are first time parents but have friends who have young children. We always try to get out of spending the night at their house because the diaper pail in the spare bathroom smells so bad. We took a strangers advice (no one we knew believed in a diaper pail that didn\'t stink) and we purchased this product. We couldn\'t be happier. At first we used it for disposable diapers which worked fine, but we were worried about how it was going to hold up when we started using cloth diapers. Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top. We did run in to that once, it means the diaper champ is full and you need to empty it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I wasn\'t going to get a diaper disposal system because I knew I did not want a new baby and then worrying about making sure I had the proper garbage bags.  But, I found the Diaper Champ and love it!  It works well and I went to Costco and purchased enough bags to last until the babies in high school for under twenty bucks!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is by far the best diaper disposal system we have found. You don\'t need any special bags - we usually just buy a roll of 35 13-gallon bags from Target for 99 cents. Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don\'t have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ. Your odor problem will be solved.I would recommend this to everyone.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.  It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).  It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.  As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.  For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.  Now that our son\'s diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.  We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).  It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a wonderful product.  One suggestion to the manufacturer--the blue piece that holds the bag in place--perhaps the mouth of this could be made bigger so that an 8 gallon trash bag actually fills up completely before you need to take it out.  Right now, it\'s only about 1/2 to 2/3 full before we have to remove it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I did a lot of research before buying a ""diaper system"" (asked friends, read other reviews on amazon, consulted baby product guides, etc.).  There didn\'t seem to be a consensus on the best one out there.  However, I have been very happy with my Diaper Champ purchase - the stink is contained, the dirty diapers drop in easily and it uses regular kitchen bags (no special bags required like other systems).",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The best feature is that you can use your own garbage bags.  This makes the investment in a diaper pail a one-time occurance!!  The Diaper Champ works by using a piston-type chute.  You put the diaper in the chute, flip the handle, and the piston slide the diaper down into the bag below.  Nothing fancy...nothing to break!So far, it has worked great.  We change the bags 1-2 times per week.  Yes, it is stinky when you remove the bag, but what do you expect?!  We did put an sticky deodorant in the pail to help.  I agree with previous reviews...you still have to clean the thing!!When comparing to my sister\'s Diaper Genie, this is much simpler to use and costs much less over its lifetime.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This has been a fantastic diaper pail for us.  We went through a Diaper Genie with each of our first two children, and this third time, I\'m so glad we tried the Diaper Champ.  It has proven to be far better than the Diaper Genies.  Our baby is 7 months old now and eating solids, and the odors have not been a problem.  Not buying special bags has been great.  No twisting; no cutting; no blades to wear out.  Wish we\'d used this with our first two.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"As much as I hear you all on the Diaper Champ - it is fabulous - the SMELL factor is greatly reduced when you take the trouble to empty diapers into the lavatory first.  This is what you are SUPPOSED to be doing.  Feces should NOT go into landfills because they can carry bacteria and intestinal viruses which can filter into, and contaminate, groundwater and soils.  Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!  Please be more conscientious!  Do your part and put the poop in the pot and help to preserve our precious planet for that little person whose bottom you are currently managing.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Baby Luke can turn a clean diaper to a dirty diaper in 3 seconds flat. The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into ""what diaper smell"" in less time than that. I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery. This is one of the best purchases we made. The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend\'s house REALLY reinforced that!! There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genieplus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn\'t any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I find this product easy to operate.  With any diaper pail you will have odor, but folding the diapers up and using the sticky tabs on the diapers to keep the diaper folded will help keep odor away.  We bought 2, one for near the crib and one for the main floor.  BRILLIANT idea...didn\'t have to run up the stairs just to throw the diaper out.  Another helpful idea...put used diaper wipes in the diaper before folding the diaper up...otherwise the wipe will sometimes get caught in the slider and leave poopies on the pail.  How often did we have to empty it?  -  twice/wk when he was 0-3 months...once a wk after that.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I decided to register for this diaper pail mainly because of the fact that it didn\'t require special bags.  My baby is now almost 6 weeks old and we are really happy with it.  You can use regular kitchen garbage bags and our nursery doesn\'t smell at all.  It\'s very easy to use.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I believed the reviews of this product, and bought it when my baby was an infant.  It worked very well while I was still breastfeeding, but once we started solid food, the smell was pretty bad.  Each morning when we went into his room, the whole place smelled like diapers.  Still, I resisted the diaper genie, because I didn\'t want to spend the money on the refills.  However, by 10 months, we had enough, and finally bought a diaper genie.  What a difference!!  The only time smell escapes is when we empty it.  To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell.  If it is not worth it to you, just buy a regular garbage can--it will work just as well as the &quot;champ&quot;.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,If you dont want the baby room to smell bad and do not want to worry buying special bags all time. This is the product for you.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Easy to change bags.Stable when changing bags (others are not!!!) - won\'t topple over.REGULAR GARBAGE BAGSOne hand use.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I love this diaper pale and wouldn\'t dream of trying anything else.  It is great that you can use regular trashbags and not have to buy expensive cartridges.  So far it has done great on containing the odor and I like how easy it is to use.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Worth every single penny and then some! I orginally registered for the famous ""Diaper Genie"" but was so thankful that my mother-in-law purchased this one instead after doing some research of her own. No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can\'t beat that! I am even thinking of purchasing one for my upstairs as well. Definitely the best one on the market.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I got this for my daughter and I just think it\'s great. We have this in her room and I haven\'t smelled any ordors coming from it except for when you open it up to take out the bag. I also love the fact that you can use just regular bags. I know of someone that had a diaper genie and she still had a diaper in it from when her baby was born and she was about 2 months at that time. I\'ve found that when it starts getting alittle full just shake it to level the diapers out and you will be able to get more in there. I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven\'t had to try this yet. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have to say I really like the Diaper Champ, with one exception-it is definitely NOT always odor free.  I have had to put it in the bathroom now instead of the baby room, because smells from &quot;stinky&quot; diapers will seep out.  I think the best advice is to wrap the really smelly ones in a plastic bag before putting them in. Another word of advice-keep a can of Lysol next to it to spray when you throw a diaper away. It can also be hard to open-I\'ve broken several nails on it.  I\'ve only had it a few weeks (I\'ve been using it for my toddler\'s diapers until my new baby comes), and I\'m hoping that the latch on it loosens up a bit with opening and shutting. Otherwise, it\'s great that it holds more diapers, and it\'s SO much easier to put the diapers in it than the Diaper Genie I had.  I don\'t need two hands for it!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We are cloth diaper users and were attracked to the diaper champ because it said it could be used for cloth diapers and it keeps the smell in unlike other diaper pails. We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes. Some of our diaper covers also got stuck in the mechanism and I had to take it apart with a screwdriver to avoid ripping the cover. Mine is now in a closet and I\'m using a regular garbage pail. If you are planning to use cloth, this is not the pail for you.If your are using disposables, I think this pail would be great since you can wad them up into a tight ball. It doesn\'t stink except when you open it to change the liner and it takes regular bags.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After reading the reviews and comparing with the diaper genie, I went with the diaper champ; mainly because it didn\'t require expensive refills. I love that i can use my own trash bags! I change the bags about 2 times/week and have not noticed any smells. I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning). Overall, highly recommend it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the Diaper Champ. I fought with the Diaper Geanie throughout my first son. This is so much easier to use, the three year old has mastered it! Uses your own bags. Don\'t waste time with others.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received the Champ at my baby shower, and continue to thank my sister for it. My son can really drop a load, and you would almost never know it once it is in the pail. We do basic maintenance, like cleaning it every so often and spraying Lysol to keep it fresh. We save SOOO much money buying 150 ct 13 gal garbage bags for about $5. My one suggestion would be to change the bags out more ofen then needed, though. It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out. I highly recommend owning one. Good Luck!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is an excellent idea having the lid to dispose of diapers.There is no odor and extremely easy to use. Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,It is so easy to use. You never have to change any cartridges and you can use an ordinary garbage bag. I love it and we have never had any smell escape from it.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this diaper pail. Yea, if you let poopy diapers sit in it for too long and don\'t change the bag on a regular basis it will start to stink but  c\'mon its a bucket full of poopy diapers.As you child grows, or if you have older children watch out. The handle system fascinates  little ones and they find it amusing that they can put something in, flip it and it disappears,  which is good when it\'s a diaper, bad when it\'s,,, your keys.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This diaper pail is great. It is the third one that I have tried. I just wish that I had it 4 years ago with my first child. It is very easy to use. You don\'t need special liners or refills. A regular garbage bag works fine. I had the Diaper Genie and it didn\'t keep odors out. The Diaper Champ doesn\'t totally keep odors away, but it works just as well if not better than the others I have tried. The diaper champ is very easy to use. You only need one hand to ""operate"" it. My 2 year old loves ""helping"" out and can independently use it.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a great diaper disposal system, but from reading many of the negative reviews I think there are many individuals who did not bother to read the instructions. the bag goes through the hole in the blue retaining ring,  then gets folded over the retaing ring and locked in place, at no point should any of the bag be out side the pale and if the bag is put in place like a regular trash can it will not seal properly and you will probaly get a smell. I can not comment on the few reviews who had a seal falure for I have not had mine long enough.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I read many reviews about diaper disposals and decided on the Diaper Champ and am VERY glad I did!  I had only heard about diaper genie but had never used it until I was visiting my brother who had one.  Now that I have used both, I am even more certain that I like the diaper champ!  With the diaper genie, you have to push the dirty diaper low enough so you can then twist the lid (the whole diaper sausage thing).  I didn\'t know that until I used it.  YUCK!  Plus what a pain when you have a baby in your hand.  The diaper champ is much easier...put the diaper in the lid and then flip the lid from one side to the other.  Being able to use regular trash bags is what hooked me in but now that I have used it, I\'m sold!  There\'s no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.  Just keep a stick-up in the diaper champ, and you\'ll be fine!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Let\'s face it.  This is a specially designed garbage can to hold human feces.  One cannot expect that it will be odor free.  Mine certainly isn\'t.  It is my fault, though.  If I emptied the bag more often, there would not be a stench.  But alas, I am lazy.  So when I do change the bag, I also spray some lysol.  Works for me.  I like it that you just have to flip the handle for the diaper to go bye bye.When I first got the product, I really hurt my finger trying to open the thing.  But that was my own fault.  I did not have it on the floor.  When opening the lid, step on the stabilizer ring at the bottom of the unit and it opens with ease.I too love that you do not have to buy special bags for this.  What a pain to have to remember to buy and then spend five bucks a pop on Genie bags.  Thanks, but no.All in all, I really like my Diaper Champ.  It\'s also taller than the genie which is good for me, I don\'t have to bend over so much to flip the lid.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"i love this diaper champ..not only does it save money on bags cause you use whatever brand you want it is bigger so it holds more and i havent had a smell come out of it!  My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!  Another nice thing about it is you can put other items in it besides just diapers, and unlike the diaper genie you dont have to push down and smoush the diaper to get it in.  Wonderful item!!  (as you can tell i have use the diaper genie with my first child)  totally recommend the diaper champ!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This item is great, you can you any bags you want (unlike the diaper Genie)!!!!! It is great for the price!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!!  After you turn the handle to bring the diaper down, if there are more than a few diapers in there, it gets stuck and you have to turn it a few times to get it down.  It smells pretty bad after a day or two, and this is after cleaning it with Pine Sol AND letting it air out!!The only advantage is that you can use your own bags, but what good is that if you are constantly cleaning it and spraying Lysol??",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"If you can love a diaper pail that is...  The Diaper Champ is EASY to use (one hand) and very sturdy.  No parts to break unlike the other leading brand.  It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.  Here\'s a tip:  Tie dirty diapers in grocery sacks before depositing into the Diaper Champ.  NO SMELL WHATSOEVER that way!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"For my first born I purchased the Diaper Genie. It worked out well for the first 6 months. As the diaper sizes got larger the harder it was to get the diaper to fit. It would squish out the sides, making a horrible mess! So I purchased the wide mouth size. More $$! The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie. SO in a search for something better than a smelly garbage can in our baby\'s room, we found the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ out performed the Diaper Genie, not once was the diaper too large to fit in the top of the unit and it was cost effective because it uses your standard trash bags!On trash day, we would open the top pull out the old bag, tie it up, throw in a new one, and out to the corner for trash pickup.Ten years and 3 more kids later, this diaper pail is still the Champ in our house!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received my Diaper Champ at my baby shower for the birth of my first son 11 months ago. I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week! I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don\'t need to purchase any special expensive bags. One thing you might want to be careful of, however...make sure you do not throw loose baby wipes into the Diaper Champ or else the flip mechanism can become jammed and after time will not seal properly due to having to pull out wipes that are stuck. I love my diaper champ so much, I have asked for a second one for my upcoming baby shower for my second son.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am a second time mom who used the rival Diaper Genie the first time around and let me tell you that there is no comparison. The Diaper Champ is easy to use, easy to change and uses everyday garbage bags instead of the expensive refills. Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell. The Diaper Champ is not perfect, it sometimes feels as if it has filled up too quickly (i.e. maybe it\'s not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison. So, I would strongly recommend that you buy the Diaper Champ and not waste your time, money and patience with the other product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,GOOD POINTS:Easy to operate and change.Less expensive to use than comperable products.Kept smell in for several months as other products did.We were unable to break it after 10 mos unlike competitors.BAD POINTS:Toddler kept flipping it back and forth and touching where we put the diapers.Did not keep room odor free after several mos of use.,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Great size, we only change each week but after 5 months the smell started to seep through and the nursery after 8 months is smelling too much of diapers now, despite airfreshners etc.  If my baby used this as a bedroom, he sleeps with us I would have replaced this sooner !!  I even washed it all our in bleach but the seals must have gone as its just getting worse.  I like the size though and love the fact you just put the diaper in dirty and swing the top over.  One problem with this is when it gets full the diapers get stuck - thats not very pleasent too.Going to BabyRUs this morning as after 8 months I decided today is the day its ready totally for a new one.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am really disappointed with the Diaper Champ.  It worked great at first, but then the foam seal broke and it wouldn\'t contain the smell.  Babies \'R Us gratiously exchanged it for another one and it happened again.  I would say it\'s a product default.  We always made sure the tape was tucked in, etc., but the foam liner just kept coming out.  Plus, sometimes when the diaper was really heavy and big, like in the morning when they\'re soaked, it wouldn\'t fit in the chamber and turn properly, so we\'d have to jam it in there, gross!Otherwise, the champ worked well on odors and accepting diapers.  I\'m pregnant with baby #2 and will look into other diaper pails.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"As a first time mother, I wanted to get the best for my daughter. I shopped around a lot, and asked a lot of questions. While at someone\'s house, I saw the Diaper Champ. It was one that I hadn\'t seen very much in the various stores I shopped in. I was immediately impressed by the ease of it, and the convenience of being able to use ANY bag!!!When I bought it, I didn\'t have a chance to show my husband how to use it -- but no worries!!! It is so simple to figure out how to use! My nephew -- a toddler, knows how to use it (without him being able to open it up!)I\'ve even recommended it to strangers in the baby stores!You\'ll love it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I like the slim shape and that you can use regular tall kitchen bags with the Diaper Champ. BUT, it really isn\'t that great in controlling odor. Sometimes diapers get stuck in the ""flipping tube"" and then you have to open it and pull it out... what a mess! It isn\'t all that easy to clean either.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We\'ve now had the Diaper Champ for a little over a year! We love it. It\'s better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn\'t smell! I highly recommend it. Drawbacks: it doesn\'t hold that many diapers at a time. We have 2 in dapers and we changes it 3 times a week or so. It needs to be cleaned pretty often or lots of mold and bacteria start to grow (on the parts you can\'t see until you take it apart). Lastly part of the fabric/plastic material has ripped on part of it so it is a bit harder to flip back in forth when you  put new dirty diapers in! Overall, this is a great product!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ. It was highly recommended by a new mom with an infant. Big mistake, her baby as well as most of the people reviewing this positively are using it with their INFANTS, so their diapers do not smell like that of a one or two year old toddler!!!!!!!!  The Genie does a much better job of masking the odors, Yes, it is more cumbersome in terms of changing out the plastic....but that I can live with.  The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We put a Diaper Genie on the shower list for the first baby. We used it for 2 years and it was OK but we were fed up with it and I took a chance on the Diaper Champ for #2. After 5 months, we couldn\'t be happier with Diaper Champ. Here\'s a short list of the main reasons I\'d recommend this against diaper genie:5. Diaper Champ doesn\'t use expensive refills like the genie. We were going through 2-3 of those $5 refills a month with the genie. On the conservative side, say that was $120 a year in genie refills. With the Diaper Champ, I bought one big box of Glad Kitchen drawstring bags (150 bags) for $15 at the warehouse club. We change the bag 1-2x weekly. The 150 bags will probably last 1 1/2 -2 years, for $15. (The Champ box says you can use plastic grocery bags. Don\'t. They\'re way too small and don\'t hold enough diapers to make it worth the while.)4. The Champ holds a lot more than the genie. Less frequent emptying.3. The genie was a pain to empty and even more work to change refills. Emptying involves tying off the tiny little sausage tube bag, restarting the cut end of the refill. Pain. Changing the refill was just annoying. When the refill runs out, there\'s not enough bag to tie so you are stuck holding an open end of a dirty diaper bag. I don\'t need that. And at any change or refill, you have to find another bag to drop the sausage string of dirty diapers into. With the champ, I open the lid, tie off the drawstring bag and that bag goes straight into the garbage can. The new bag goes in as simple as a trash-can liner and close the lid.2. The genie broke after about 15 months. There are 4 little plastic prongs inside that hold the diaper in place while you twist the ring to seal the diaper in the bag. The spring on one broke and it never held the diapers well again after that.1. And my top reason why the diaper champ is champ: It\'s perfectly easy to use, impossible to use wrong. Whenever we had a babysitter or family member helping while we used the genie, we always took a couple of minutes to show them how to use it. We\'d come home and every time, they\'d gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in. No, it\'s not difficult to use or get right once you do it a few times but if you only use it once a month, that dial on top that turns the cutter is just to obvious to turn to ignore and impossible not to turn. Every single time someone got it wrong. So, the Diaper Champ. you drop the diaper in the open hole and flip the handle and it\'s gone. I can\'t think of a way anyone could do it wrong and most people who\'ve used it so far, don\'t need even the simplest hint from us on how to use it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I love this diaper pail. It keeps the diapers from stinking up your room/house. I also love that I can use regualer old kitchen bags and dont\' have to fork over extra bucks for special bags. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish that it held more diapers.,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I chose this product because unlike the Diaper Genie you don\'t have to buy replacement bags, just pop in a tall kitchen garbage bag which we all have in our homes anyway.  I have twin boys and this product works great.  I recommend spraying it with Lysol and letting it air dry in between bag changes.  This works for me.  It also holds a lot of diapers.  I highly recommend it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'m SO glad that we asked the sales associate at Babies R Us for help when picking out a diaper pail.  We were going to get a Diaper Genie like so many folks do, but the associate showed us the Diaper Champ and how easy it was to use. All I have to do is turn the handle and the diaper goes down.  There\'s no twisting and no special liners to buy.  As far as smell goes, ALL diaper pails will smell if they\'re not changed often enough.  We don\'t have a problem with ours smelling as long as we change it every three to four days (which should be done no matter what product you buy).  When I got pregnant with my second child (they are only 18months apart) we bought a second Diaper Champ.  We also just purchased one for my brother-in-law and his wife for their new baby.  Before buying ANY other diaper pail, compare it to this one first.  You\'ll be amazed at how easy it is to use.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Love it, love it, love it!  This lives up to the hype.  You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don\'t change it or clean out.  You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.  It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it\'s no problem.  I have recommended this to all new parents!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have been very happy with this pail.  The greatest thing... regular trash bags!!  The Next greatest thing... 1 handed operation & it takes only a SECOND! Awesome!I have not had any issues with odor.  I change the bag every 5-6 days or so.  If the plunger is not going down, it\'s because you need to change the bag!!The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because changing the bag takes a few minutes.  It can be difficult to open, ALthough, when my daughter gets older and starts getting into things, this will probably be a blessing! :)",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After using this for 3 years, I still stunned that other people still use the Diaper Genie.  I\'ve even had other Moms tell me that they can\'t smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.  If anyone is having trouble, though, try:  a)  wrapping the tabs securely around the diaper; b)  using deodorant trash bags;  and c)  taking dirty diapers straight outside to the trash and using your diaper pail just for wet diapers.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I loved this compared to the genie. It is easier to use and less costly in the long run!!Two thumbs up!!!Now, only if it would spray a freshner on its own. LOL!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We got the Diaper Champ because we thought it was smart to use regular garbage bags and not pay for the diaper Genie refills. BIG MISTAKE! This product does not keep odor in, and when you open it up to put in a new bag in, its all over. My daughter\'s room stinks because of this product and we are in the process of trying to find a REAL odorless diaper pail.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I returned the Diaper G**** that I was given but kept this!  It takes ANY garbage bag (no expensive refills) and is wonderful for controlling odor... that\'s especially important now that our little guy is eating solid food and making more stinky diapers!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband saw this after my first shower and said ""What\'s that thing for?""  He now loves it.  I do too.  Best of all, you don\'t have to buy specific bags, we use the bags from the grocery and they do quite well.  We\'ve bought some air freshener cans and put them in the bottom, because after 8 months of use, it\'s going to smell.  But the room does not carry the smell, only when you\'re on the floor near the genie.  My only issue is that I\'ve broken a nail or two lifting the latch to get the top open.  But it\'s infinitely better than having the smell!!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We received the Diaper Champ as a shower gift.  It worked great for the 1st 5 months.  As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I highly recommend this item.  It is a must!  I registered for the diaper genie and used it for about a week and couldn\'t stand it.  It broke,the refills are expensive and very hard to install.  Then I got the diaper champ.  What a difference.  Easy to use, just one hand, and no odors.  It uses just your basic tall garbage bags.  So you don\'t have to go out and buy special bags for it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I originally registered for the Diaper Genie, but we changed our minds when we considered that we would only be able to use the Diaper Genie refills.  The Diaper Champ allows you to use regular garbage bags.  Plus it\'s simple to use.  We haven\'t had a problem with odor at all.  It\'s a great product!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a 10 year old daughter and an 8 month old son. There was nothing like this when I had my first child and I really looked into the champ v\'s genie before I brought this and I have to say that I truly LOVE it. I change the bag once a week. My kids have to share a room so if it was smelly I would hear about it. I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new. Aside form that it is so easy to use with one hand, anyone with a wiggly baby will appreciate that. In fact I love it so much I am going to take one all the way to Australia with me for my niece since she can\'t get them over there. I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is easy, but horribly smelly.  I suggest saving your money and buying a regular trash can.  You will get the same effect, because this doesn\'t do anything special.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"...make sure I tell people about this product. I read the reviews, and at the time, this was the only diaper pail that got any decent reveiws, and now I know why. I bought one for upstairs, and liked it so much I bought one for downstairs. I still have on in my registery hoping someone will get me a third one for my mother in law\'s house. I just use a standard pull string kitchen trash bag, and use it according to the instructions (in other words if you follow the procedure of opening and sinching the bag before removal then you won\'t have a problem) and it works great, good design!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'ve given this can as a gift a few times now.  Once to a couple who were on their second child, their response was \'how\'d we survive through the first baby without that can\'.It\'s easy, ordourless, and clean.  What more could new parents on.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I have 2 kids in diapers and the diaper champ has been great for us for 2 1/2 years. Easy to use and change. I love that it uses reg bags. :),5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for this after reading all the reviews and I\'ve been nothing but happy with it. I tried my sister\'s diaper genie and the diaper champ is so much easier to use. The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier. I just leave some in the bottom of the champ then I don\'t have to go looking for them. I\'ve never noticed a smell, and although I do agree that it is hard to open, you get used to it and it\'s worth it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have ours in our living room and you can\'t smell a thing.  It is a little difficult to open and it doesn\'t hold a lot of diapers, but overall it works well.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have had a great experience with this product so far and have been using it for about 2 months.  I get absolutely no odors in the tiny nursery (even when my daughter had very smelly diarrhea), it\'s easy to use and DOES NOT NEED ANY EXPENSIVE REFILL BAGS (just regular garbage bags) and I would recommend it to anyone.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.  I remember reading a good review about the Diaper Champ and deciding to get it.Honestly, it does a great job.  It does contain the odor to inside the Champ.  I have never noticed a smell in the room, even when it is full.  I have to admit, however, that when you open that bad boy up to empty it, it\'s pretty funky, but what do you expect?If you wrap up your diapers good and empty it before it gets so full that you can\'t squeeze another diaper into it, you will really be happy.  It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.  We use the scented bags, which we think helps a lot.Overall, we are very pleased with the Diaper Champ and would recommend it highly! (Only reason I rated it 4out of 5 stars is - nothing\'s perfect, I have a hard time giving out 5 to anything!)",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a great product until your little one starts to play with the handle.  Because the flip-flop handle comes in contact with the dirty diapers when the bag gets full, curious fingers can pick up some nasty germs &amp; even poop if a diaper isn\'t wrapped up into itself (The Grandmas seem to have trouble with that).I have been very happy with the simplicity of the Champ &amp; using regular garbage bags until now.  However, my 14 month old loves to play with it &amp; flip the handle over. I just cringe when I think about what he gets on his hands.Also, the padding in the lid that keeps odor under control seems to have worn out after 1 year.  It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too. YUCK!Overall, I would recommend the Champ for infants because it\'s VERY easy &amp; you can use 1 hand, but now that I have a toddler I\'m looking for a pail with a locking lid.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My son is now 5 mo. and overall, I\'m happy with the diaper champ.  I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags. Do not kid yourself that you will have an odor-free diaper pail--I do not think that is possible!  I would rate this as low-odor--I change the bag about once a week.  My complaint, though, is that the plunger-cylinder thing gets stuck because the diapers begin to stack on top of one-another even when the bag is newly-changed.  Also, I do not use the plunger for messy diapers because if the tabs are nor fastened, the tabs get stuck in the plunger thing.  I do not wrap up the messy ones because of the leak factor, so I wind up having to open the lid frequently. The lid is a bit difficult to open, but I like that because when my little guy is more mobile he won\'t be able to open it!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,The diaper champ is fantastic. You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags. There is absolutely no dirty diaper smell that comes from the Diaper Champ.Absolutely recommend this product.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this pail.  You just drop the diaper in the hole, and flip the handle/lid.  Sooooo simple.  It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.  With the Diaper Genie, you have to open the lid, shove your arm in the pail, twist 3 times, then wipe off your arm if you know what I mean.  (It also needs special cartridges).  With the Diaper Champ, there is no mess and the diaper is gone in 1 second!  It holds more diapers too.  I definitely recommend it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was given the Diaper Geni and after a week of twisting, we bought the Diaper Champ.  This was a great choice.  There is no need to spend extra money on special bags.  We use ordinary supermarket bags.  In order to keep the smell under control, we sprinkle baking soda right at the bottom of the chamber.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I got this pail because I felt it was good that it doesn\'t require you to buy ""their"" garbage bags.  But at the end I still didn\'t use it and just use a regular pail.  Now it\'s sitting in my basement.  The reason I didn\'t use it is because it is hard to open up the can to replace the bag and when you are actually cleaning a baby especially when it\'s #2 it is messy at times where you would probably get it in the pail before you flip the handle to dispose of it.  Well then you  now need to clean the pail as well as the baby.  You don\'t need more work with a child.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Worst diaper pale ever!!  I\'ve had mine for 2 years now and I am throwing it away as soon as my second Decor arrives.  No matter how many times I clean the ""Chump"" it still stinks.  The diapers and wipes get caught in the drop hole and stuck wet wipes make it stink even worse.  Forget scented trash bags, they won\'t cure the smell of the ""Chump"".  Also, watch out when changing the bag, you may lose a finger if the lid unexpectedly slams shut on you when changing it.  Forget this pale and go for the Decor.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad. She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ. Boy am I glad! It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle!! My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS!!! I don\'t know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing...it\'s sealed up like Ft. Knox. You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it. The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag, thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail. I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it!!!!!!!!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is my second child. With my first, I went through the Diaper Genie and hated it ---her nursery always smelled, even though my husband regularly changed that annoying (and expensive refill, $5.00 for each refill adds up faster than you think!) diaper system, he even took it outside and hosed it down with Clorox bleach and sprayed it regularly with Lysol -- to no avail.We also tried the Neat Diaper disposal system, and it\'s pretty and works a little better than the Genie, but it still smells up the room.  The Diaper Champ wins hands down, I for one never had an odor problem and I love the fact that it\'s easy to use and easy to empty, it\'s also easy to dispose of the diaper with one hand (especially when you\'re holding and infant and don\'t want to leave a smelly diaper out of the pail), something I couldn\'t do with neither the Genie not the Neat pail.I highly recommend it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diperchamp is easy to use, as other people have said. We bought it with our first child, but stopped using it before she turned one. It does not keep the smell in and with only one stinky diper in there my daughter\'s entire room would smell the moment you walked in.I really loved the diperchamp when she was a newborn and her dipers did not smell. Now that we are pregnant with our second child I am not planning on using it again because we did not use it for very long.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I like BabyTrend\'s products. We also have a SnapNGo, and we also seriously considered the Trend High Chair. We\'ve been using the Diaper Champ for almost a year now since our baby was born. I think it does what it advertises and that is that it does a good job of keeping in the odors (we live in a 1 bedroom condo). Pros: easy to use one-hand drop-in mechanism, good odor trapping, can use just about any kind of grocery or plastic bag, convenient handle, and easy to clean. Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing. Hint: If using spray cleaning, don\'t spray water into the drop-in hole. The mechanism is not completely watertight and you\'ll trap some water in there. Myself, I\'ve actually done a thorough cleaning only twice. Most times I just spray Lysol inside after changing to a new plastic bag.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.  You are better off just getting a garbage pail with a tight lid.  Not only did my daughter\'s room smell horrible, but I broke three finger nails trying to lift the lid.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ doesn\'t smell - how wonderful!  Also, there are no expensive bags to buy for it - you can use regular plastic bags!  Although it seems to fill up quickly(diapers tend to pile up in the middle), this is an absolute must!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I can\'t say enough good things about the Champ.  For my first son we had the Diaper Genie - but it didn\'t do the trick. (too $$ and too difficult to handle).For son #2, I read the reviews and decided to give this one a try.  I still love it!  My son (who is now 3+ years old) is finally getting potty trained, but we still use it to hold the ""nightie night dypes""...  We\'ve been using it for 3+ years and it is still going strong.According to the reviews, I was careful to wrap the diapers before putting them in - which we had to do for the Genie anyway... For the REALLY MESSY ones, I flipped up the lid and placed it right in the bag - which was easy to do.My son still loves to pull the handle and say ""bye-bye"" to what he considers the magic trash can.  For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags. If the odor inside gets too strong, try using Febreeze -- it even works on the plastic!Strongly MOM Approved!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It is so much easier to use than the Diaper Genie (my sister has that) but it does have some problems.  We\'ve used it for a year now, and it never started to smell until the diapers did.  It generally only smells when it\'s really full or you\'re emptying it out.  I wouldn\'t say the smell is such a problem though.  Whenever I empty out the bag (love the fact you can use regular trash bags) I would wipe out the inside and saturate it with Lycol for disinfecting.  The only reason why I am going to have to buy the Diaper Genie now is that my 1 year old loves to put items (sippy cups, toys, etc.) into the hole in the top and flip the handle.  I didn\'t realize he could do this until one day when a sippy cup went missing, and after EXTENSIVE searching I found it inside the diaper pail!  Since then, I have caught him many times trying to do the same thing.  Over all, it\'s a good product.  I think if you smell strong odors coming from the Diaper Champ, it\'s time to clean and empty it!",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,My husband and I registered for the Diaper Champ without really knowing much about it.  We picked it because it did not require purchasing refills like the Diaper Genie (which my sister-in-law had and did not really like).  We really like our Diaper Champ because it does not require refills (it uses regular kitchen trash bags)and it keeps out odor completely.  I am recommending this to all my pregnant friends.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My son is now 18 months old and I have to say that the diaper champ is one of our favorite purchases! We got it when I was pregnant in hopes it would keep our house smelling ok. Well, it does pretty well at that, you still have to change it out everyday, it is poop however!!! But the thing I love most is that I can just use my kroger bags!! With buying diapers and toys, I didn\'t need something else on my list to buy! What a great invention!!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"... than deal with the odor from this pail.  Even changing the whole bag (we tried plastic grocery sacks, tall kitchen bags, even heavy duty garbage bags) every day didn\'t help.  We\'ve moved this product to the garage and purchased a Diaper Genie for the nursery.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I LOVED my Champ for the first year as it was all I expected in ease, cleanliness, odor free with regular bag changes and the economical use of kitchen bags.  Then the liner began to come loose and get stuck in the tumbler and eventually had to be removed altogether making things a bit less odor resistant, but still manageable with regular bag changes, cleanings, airings and sprinklings of baking soda.  The real problem we have now is that no amount of cleaning and deoderizing the Champ after a bag change (about twice a week for us) has managed to eliminate the strong odor that seems to be clinging to the actual pail now.  We\'ve tried a number of disinfectants, deoderizers and air freshners, but they are no match for the offensive odor of the Champ even when clean and empty.  We are so disappointed in the short-term success of this product.  It has been removed from my son\'s room and we are now taking each diaper out individually and looking for another pail.  I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.  In light of our experience with the Champ, I\'d have to recommend not purchasing this pail unless you are prepared to replace it when it fails to do it\'s no-odor diaper duty in due time.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a two-year-old son and I love the Diaper Champ. We initially bought a Diaper Genie and used it for the first 9 months or so, but we really disliked it. It was difficult to use, loud, and then broke on us. We switched the Diaper Champ and love it. It contains our toddler\'s odors just fine. We change the bag once a week and when we change a diaper we make sure to roll it up tightly and use the sticky tabs to close it up.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I bought this after being gievn a diaper genie as a gift. This is much easier to use. You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags. I highly recommend the diaper champ for storing stinky diapers.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is a great product and a good value for those on a budjet.  Using lysol after changing the bag works well.  I have used my Diaper champ for 3 years and it still works!! I recommed this product to everyone I know.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I also opted for the Diaper Champ because there isn\'t any refills. It is very easy to use, but is difficult to open. I\'m afraid of ripping a fingernail completely off everytime I change the bag. My problem is with odor control. There isn\'t any. My newborn daughter\'s room smells constantly. It only takes ONE poopy diaper to smell. Yes we do change the bag regularly per other posts. We had to keep a fan on in her room during the summer just to keep the odor from a choking level. No exaggeration! If the smell wasn\'t a problem, I\'d completely recommend this product.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,It\'s so much better then the diaper genie. No special bags necessary! Occasionally there are some bad odors but it\'s nothing that can\'t be fixed with some febreeze or lysol!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My baby\'s room has absolutely NO odor because of the Diaper Champ.  The chamber holds many diapers ( a day full at least) with no odor at all.  I also love that it takes regular trash bags so it\'s economical.  I spray the top and handle daily with Lysol or use Clorox wipes in the receptacle to keep it sanitary, but otherwise NO ODORS leak out!  We change the trash bag daily but you could get away with two days.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I read a review below that can explain exactly what we experienced. We\'ve had it for 16 months and it has worked wonderful for us. No smells, change it out once a week, easy to clean. Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part, so I pulled the rest of the foam out. Big mistake!!! Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we\'re looking for a replacement. Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces. I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This thing freakin\' stinks. Literally. I changed the bags every 1-2 days and wiped with clorox wipes and sprayed with lysol AND used vanilla scented bagsand we could still smell the smells seeping through!! Now I just throw the diapers in the regular trash since I change the bags everyday anyway and we can\'t smell a thing now. Someone else told me this thing stinks and I should have listened to them.,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Almost bought a diaper genie and then read on-line reviews.  Glad we listened!  Very easy to use.  Easy to open to empty and easy to replace trash bags. Nice that you can use regular trash bags from any store.  So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.  If you look at the picture you might understand.  After you flip the handle, the diaper on the inside goes into the bag when the cylinder you place it in is vertical, or completely upside down.  On the sides, there are walls that are snug to the round part that flips around. It is between the round diaper flipper thing and the walls that stuff could potentially get caught.  It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We\'ve only noticed something in this space once or twice. We still recommend this product.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We\'ve had the Diaper Champ for 18 months, and it worked great, no smells, very easy to use, until recently.  Somehow (probably it got overloaded) the adhesive from a diaper snagged the foam that insulates the head of the champ and pulled just the teeniest tiniest corner out.  Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.  We\'re going to get another, but just BEWARE -- these can fail.  Check you Champ carefully to make sure that no mesh or foam are visible.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.  When it came down to it, I couldn\'t make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills. Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.  Let\'s face it, babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should!!!I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags, but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!If I had it to do over again, I would still buy the Diaper Champ!  I think it is great!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have one for the nursery and one downstairs in what we call our ""satellite"" nursery where we keep our pack & play. My daughter is nearly 8 mos now, and we use both of them pretty equally. However, the one in the nursery is smelly, the one downstairs you can\'t detect the slightest odor from. We change both of them out at least 2-3x/week. I tried cleaning out the smelly one, getting the foam soaked with lysol and letting it dry out in the hot LV sun - I figured the scorching heat alone would kill anything, but I can still detect an odor from it - it doesn\'t stink up the whole nursery, but if you\'re standing right next to it you get a whiff. The foam inside has just absorbed the stink and there\'s no getting rid of it. All of this being said, I don\'t know that there is any other diaper pail that is much better - my brother has a diaper genie and he says it stinks a lot, he has to change his every day. My girlfriend has tried a few different pails and doesn\'t think any one is better than another.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I wanted this style (vs. the Diaper Genie) because it uses regular kitchen trash bags.  This is a more efficient way to go both because you can buy these bags anywhere and they are less expensive compared to the specialty bags for the Genie.  The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.  Overall, we are very pleased with our purchase and recommend it highly.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don\'t have problem with the smell.  I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.  We have to change the bag every couple of days, when it is not even full because it is pretty disgusting.So just because of that I would not recommend it.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The reason their are mixed reviews on the Diaper Champ is because not all Diaper Champs are created equal (hee, hee).  We purchased one and we loved it.  No odor, we loved that you could use any bag, we were very happy.  So happy, we bought a second one.  OH MY GAH!  It was horrid.  The odors were so strong we thought our nursery maybe toxic (not really, smile).  We thought maybe it was just us, so we called in for a second opinion (the Mother-in-law).  She started gagging, and that was our sign to bring in the gas masks and rid of the Diaper Champ.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.  In just a few months use, the Diaper Champ pays for itself by saving money on costly refills needed for other brands.  I have never had an odor problem, but I have a 5-month-old breastfed baby, so I know her diapers now are not as stinky as they will get once we go to solids.  I also use the Glad ""Odor-Control"" bags (the price of 100 bags is probably about the same as a DG RF and will last over a year).  The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.  I highly recommend it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have never written a review for Amazon but I saw some of the poor reviews on the Diaper Champ and had to add my two cents . . .When my sister got pregnant she could not decide if she should register for the Diaper Champ or the Diaper Genie.  She left it up to me and after reviewing both items I went with the Diaper Champ . . .  The idea of having to continually purchase bags for the Diaper Genie seemed like a waste when the Diaper Champ lets you use any type of bag . . .  My nephew is now over two years old and while he has begun potty training, my sister still uses the Diaper Champ I gave her . . .When it came time for me to choose a diaper disposal system, I put the Diaper Champ on my registry.  Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?  True, the mechanism sometimes won\'t ""swing"" the dirty diaper into the pail but HELLO that is a sign that it is probably time to put in a new bag.  Yes, it can eventually start to smell if you don\'t change it regularly . . . but then again if you used a metal safe lined with carbon to hold your kids diapers eventually baby poop and pee smell would emanate from it if you didn\'t clean it out regularly . . . Realistically the thing holds dirty stinky diapers and yep it is going to smell when you open it but hey . . . my kids tush smells when I wipe it but I still love him :)My personal tip . . . if you belong to a wholesale club like BJ\'s, Costco or Sam\'s check to see if they have the Glad Kitchen Bags.  The BJ\'s we shop in has a box of 200 for $9.99.  As long as you do not attempt to overstuff them (i.e., get lazy and don\'t change the bag regularly) they work perfectly.  I also use them in the small garbage pails in our apartment.  I could wait for a sale and use a coupon (the way I shop for most things) but it takes months to go through the box and I like knowing they are always on hand . . . At about $.05 a bag, the super duper box of bags makes my life easy and that as any parent knows is ***PRICELESS***.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After reading how great this product was on the convenience of not having to but those expensive bags ( diaper genie) I registered for the diaper champ. What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. The smell is HORRIFYING!!!! Needless to say I am now going to buy the diaper genie and those expensive bags. I shoudn\'t have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery. I strongly recommend that you DON""T buy the diaper CHUMP......",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This pail is  by far the best!  Great price, no special bags, high capacity, easy to use and most importantly...no odor!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Hands down....get this diaper pail... The only reason I ever even need to empty it is when it cant hold anymore! NEVER smells..ever! I change mine about every 2 weeks, like I said, only because thats when it seems to fill. Dont bother w/ the cheapies, this one is IT! Seriously....trust me! The reason why it never smells is because the diaper goes into like a seperate chamber before it gets to the bag, so the air never transfers.Theres nothing else I can say. This is perfection.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I admit when I was an expecting father one of my concerns was diaper changing, mostly because of the odors (anyone with me on this one?) As much as the odors won\'t go away during changing time, they do -as a matter of fact- dissapear once you throw the dirty diaper in the Diaper Champ. Put it in the top hole, roll the top with the handle, in the diaper goes and bye-bye to all odor!As if this were not already great, there\'s a big plus to this product, when you compare it to its biggest competitor, the Diaper Genie by Playtex. Although this one costs $5 the first time around, it won\'t require special bags as the Genie does, which cost $15 per set... this one takes your standard Glad bags you can get in Costco, BJs, Sam\'s or your local supermarket, so rejoice! (for diaper odors are over when the diaper goes in); and don\'t spend too much money to accomplish such a mundane task: make sure you get your Diaper Champ!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I LOOOVE this diaper pail!  Its the easiest to use!  after using the diaper genie for 2 months i decided i had enough with the refils and with how much of a pain it is to use.  I purchases this diaper pail in its place and i loooove it!  No more refills, it uses the same bags as my kitchen garbage!  And it holds alot more! I only have to empty it like once a week as oppsed to every other day with the diaper genie.  This is worth the few extra buck because you arnt spending 5 more bucks every othe rweek for refills!  I have a bunch of poopy diapers in mine and you cant even smell them! and i love the fact that you dont have to open it to put a diaper in so i can do it one handed.  Just toss the diaper in the top and flip over the handle, its sooo easy!  And with the diaper genie i noticed that the smell would leak out a bit when you opened the top.  It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!  I would definatly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a diaper pail!!!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received the Diaper Champ as a gift when my baby girl was born last year.  At first it seemed as the perfect way to keep diaper smells away; it worked like a charm.  Within four to five months it started to smell, it did not seal properly and the smell got impregnated on the plastic, it was impossible to get rid of it.  I tried to wash it, spray it, scrub it, but nothing.  Maybe the sealing system fades with use.  I used it till I couldn\'t anymore and two months ago bought the Diaper Genie.  Yes, you have to buy refils ... it does a great job a sealing smells.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My son and daughter-in-law requested this item and they are very pleased with it.  For their last child they used another brand, and  were dissatisfied.  However, they love the Diaper Champ.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Bought this on amazon. Never saw it around. Went through 3 kids. Very well madeNever would smell poopy diapers. Just use a store plastic bag and then when it\'s full, justThrow away. Love it !",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ is TERRIBLE at keeping the smelly diapers from only smelling in the container.  Our baby\'s room was constantly stinky (due to the Diaper Champ, not the baby!), and we were having to empty the container almost daily.  What\'s the point of having a diaper disposal system if you can\'t dispose of diapers efficiently?  Please don\'t buy this product unless you enjoy smelling those dirty diapers.  The Diaper Champ just doesn\'t work.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We researched all of the different types of diaper pails, including the Diaper Genie which some of our friends have, but this one takes the cake. Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal. Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go. When you are done, just pull the handle from one side to the other, and presto, you\'re done. It holds around 15-20 diapers (I have changed it probably twice a week), and you just open it, tie the bag and take it out. To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL! I highly recommend that. And you don\'t need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution. You don\'t need the Genie. My best friend has one, and not only does it stink (literally), the whole ""special bag"" thing irks me. Give this guy a try. I am so glad we did!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Clean, economical, simple. Never experienced any odor ""problems""; we just empty the receptacle every other day.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I laughed when my husband wanted this product.  I felt it was  a waste of money and that you could just throw the diapers in the garage.  Well thats not a good idea.  We have the diaper champ and never smell anything.  This is a great item that every parent needs.  Its easy to use, and you can use your own bags. We actually use kitchen bags, and they hold quite a few diapers. We only have to change the bag out about once a week. I can\'t say enough great things about the diaper champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,You cannot imagine how much money you\'ll save and it doesn\'t smell AT ALL!!! You can use any kitchen size garbage bags without a problem and use it for A WEEK without having to change the bag. IT\'S WONDERFULL!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I bought this trying to save a few dollars and when I received it I thought it felt and looked real junky. After using it for over a week I have to admit I was wrong. I have 2 babies in diapers and the Diaper Champ keeps their room smelling GREAT. It is extremely easy to use and it has the added advantage that one can use ANY plastic bag with the Champ.It is an all around great, helpful and inexpensive product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"As a Mother of 9 month old twins, I go through plenty of diapers.  We\'re moving to the U.K. in a couple of weeks, and after not being able to find a \'Champ\' anywhere overseas, I\'m having one shipped to our new home.  We\'ve never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.  I highly recommend this product to anyone!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I wanted this diaper pail over the Genie b/c I liked the idea of being able to use standard trash bags instead of special refills, plus I have NEVER been able to get a Diaper Genie to easily work!  Now that I have the Champ, I\'m glad I got it, because it\'s very easy to use, however there are a few things I don\'t like about it:1.  It\'s hard to get the lid open...I\'ve broken several nails and hurt my hand trying to pop the latch open.2.  Because of the funky ring on the inside that I haven\'t yet determined the purpose of, the diapers get clogged near the top so that the handle can\'t be turned.  There is generally more than enough room left in the trash bag, so in order to avoid changing a bag that is only a third of the way full, I have to open the lid and adjust the pile of diapers or rock the pail back and forth so the diapers fall and I can continue filling.3.  A diaper got jammed in it once when the sticky tab stuck to the foam seal in the plunger.  The only way I was able to dislodge it was to tear out the seal.  The pail still works fine, but now the plunger is loose so it bangs around when you turn the handle, which makes more noise than before.4.  I have noticed a smell on occasion, but I expected as much...it\'s a plastic can full of poop...it\'s not going to smell like roses!!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I like some features of the Diaper Champ. I do not find that it is odorless at all. I do like the one-handed operation of it. However, my toddler is constantly putting things in it and I have to paw through the dirty diapers to see what he\'s thrown away before I dispose of the bag. Using regular trash bags is nice, but I think there is something to be said for scented liners.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"For some reason, Amazon first sent us this product used...complete with poop stains!  We were very disappointed but they redeemed themselves by sending us a brand new one.  Now we are very happy with it.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We gave away our Diaper Genie and bought 2 of these when our second child was born. You use regular garbage bags and it takes less than a minute to change. No bad smells - no expensive liners. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We\'ve been using the Diaper Champ for almost 5 months now and love it. It works like advertised and keeps the odors at bay. I would recommend hosing the inside with Lysol after each bag change.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Wow!  This is fabulous.  It was a toss-up between the Diaper Genie and this one, and we decided on the Diaper Champ since you didn\'t need refill bags to go with it.  I go through a TON of diapers a day (I have twins) and instead of making a hundred trips to the trash can in the garage to get the poopie stink out of the house, I use this...and it works!  Absolutely no smell escapes from the Diaper Champ and I can use plain kitchen garbage bags in it.  We\'re very pleased with ours.  Spend the extra five dollars on this diaper disposer rather than settle for the ""Genie"".",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a friend that had the Diaper Genie and complained of it smelling on occasion.  My husband and I were a little leary of purchasing a diaper pail, but decided to give the Diaper Champ a try!  I am so glad that we did!  We have been using it for almost a month and it is great!  It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!  I would definetely recommend!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We liked this diaper pail because it uses regular trash bags.  It definatly keeps the smell contained, but, it will only hold about 15 to 20 dirty diapers before it gets clogged up.  When it is full, the lid won\'t turn over without some force.  This is a minor annoyance and it just needs to be emptied more often.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It\'s true, it does not work as well as the diaper genie. I am going back to that. I have used both and I can assure you, this product does not contain smells - I even put it in the closet, and still we smell it! Save yourself the money.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I chose this pail because I didn\'t want to spend alot on a daiper pail.  In the end, I spent more because I had to buy a different one.  After only a few months of using it, the seal broke and  the odor came through.  The latch would get stuck making it difficult to change the bag.  This is certainly not worth buying!!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.  You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This odor absorbing champ even absorbs the odors from those diaper genies down the street...  My one step diaper champ sure beats the 5 steps it takes to twist a diaper in the that genie.  Who want to do extra when you are doing enough as it is? - The CHAMP is icing on the cake - every mommy gets psyched when their boy (or girl) poops because it means everything is working... and when you toss that diaper into the the mini R2D2 unit, you know you did it right... simplicity... ahh...",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This was great for first 5 months of my baby girl. But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner. First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor. Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine. But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.I am now looking at the diaper genie.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Very easy to use, no smells at all. No special bags to buy. An easy decision.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I think this should be a staple in every household with a child!  It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.  The fact that you can use regular trash bags is a BIG plus because you don\'t have to stock up on refill\'s or run to the store when you realize you don\'t have anymore.  There is no oder (until you open it up to empty) and it is easy to use..great item!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Excellent product. Holds nearly a week of soiled diapers without release of any unpleasant odor.  Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.  Would recommend that others purchase.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We love the Diaper Champ, just wish it could hold more diapers! Really, I can\'t smell anything once the diaper is in there and it\'s very easy to load and unload. Plus, the price can\'t be beat.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this product. You can use any regular trash bag. So far we have noticed NO odors. It is easy to use. It fills up somewhat quickly, but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ. The price is very affordable as well.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received the Diaper Champ at my baby shower and have been using it since day one.  I loved it when I got it and now that I have used it for 1 1/2 years, I still love it!(First of all, if you have a poop smearing issue in your Diaper Champ, it\'s because you don\'t know how to roll a diaper closed and seal it with the tabs.  That\'s just gross, sorry I had to go there.)  Now that I have made my previous comment, even after the weight of the plunger pushed the diaper down, I have never had the issue of a ""dirty"" plunger.  The only cleaning I do to mine is wipe it down with a Clorox wipe once a week and spray it out with Lysol disinfectant spray everytime I change the bag.  I also use Glad Odor Shield kitchen bags in mine and I have never had an odor problem.My Diaper Champ is still in great condition, never had a broken part and never had a reason to need to take it a part.I would HIGHLY reccomend this to anyone who needs a WONDERFUL diaper pail.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is one of the best things that we got as a shower present. It requires no additional expense, other than regular trash bags (unlike the diaper genie) and it really works! I was skeptical that it blocked odors as claimed, but I am convinced: I forgot to change a full bag of dirty diapers before we left for a week of vacation (we have no a/c and it was really hot that week) ...We came home a week later and our daughter\'s room didn\'t smell bad at all.I do use Glad trash bags with the odor guard, wipe it out occasionally with Clorox wipes and I do keep a drier sheet in the bottom of the diaper champ just to ensure that it remains ""nice"" ... but that\'s more about keeping it clean than anything else.Bottom line, the diaper champ is something that we absolutely couldn\'t and still can\'t live without!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'ve tried the two other most popular diaper pails and am happiest with this one.  It is easy to change the bag, uses any trash bag, and does a decent job of containing odor.  I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.  I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.  Let\'s face it....no diaper pail is perfect, but this one is the best that I\'ve used.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Ok, so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome--it is very easy to use--that\'s why I gave it 1 star. However...the thing REALLY stinks!! Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it. However, the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago. I thought...""Maybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I won\'t have to purchase any liners""...Well that was a HUGE mistake!! I see why this thing got 4 stars--all of these parents have young children!! My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older, I guess her diapers come with more odor! After literally only a few diapers, her entire room smelled of poop! I couldn\'t stand it! In one week, I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times. Is that really saving money?? I don\'t think so! Plus her room really smelled bad. I\'m taking it back & getting the Neat again! The Diaper Champ must be great for infants, but you may want to consider something else for older babies!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We opted to register for this diaper pail because it didn\'t require costly refills.  It seemed to work well at first, although the changing of bags was a bit of a pain.  By the time my son was 8 months old, the pail began to stink a lot.  We always wiped it down and sprayed it with Lysol.  Eventually, a piece of foam from inside (I\'m guessing this helped to keep the smells inside) came loose.  We finally had to throw it out when my son was 9 1/2 months old. My neighber who had a baby at the same time also owned the Champ and had to toss her\'s out when her daughter was 5 months old.  The same thing happened to her.We are now expecting our second child and are in the process of buying a new pail - probably the Neat System.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I got the diaper champ at my baby shower and used it from the begining.  It was wonderful, it didn\'t smell and it held LOTS of diapers.  I was glad I got it after finding out from my sister that she had to replace her bag from her diaper genie every other day in the begining and then a least 2 times a week when my neice was older.  At $6 a bag I saved a ton of money with this product.  However now that my daughter is a year and on all regular adult foods the diaper champ isn\'t holding in the smell very well at all.  I\'ve been replacing the bag every day to prevent the smell from getting too bad but it\'s a pain to do so I\'m thinking about getting a different diaper disposal system for now.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is such an easy and clean way to dispose of dirty diapers! Quick, one hand operation & NO odor problems!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Champ is a great diaper disposal system, but smells do leak out.  As soon as you open the system to take the bag out, all of those diapers do smell up the place!  I can not say that I am 100% satisfied with this type of disposal system, I just wish there was a better way of taking out the bag without smelling up the entire room!",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Great diaper pail. It is very simple. Uses any bag. I haven\'t had any problems at all with it and it holds odor extremely well (until you open it!) But all in all a great diaper pail....definitely recommend!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I did love this product for the first year. but my oldest is 3years old and we\'ve been through two of these and now off to buy something else for my 15 month old. The seal on the cover doesn\'t last long which is why it smells. When we first get the new one it works great for a few months and then it starts smelling. We change it every other day and my 3 year old is potty trained so I\'m only using it with one toddler. The fact that you don\'t need to buy special bags is great but I wish they would figure out a better way to contain the smells.,3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought this one because it can be used with cloth or disposable diapers and uses regular (ie. cheap) garbage bags.  For cloth diapers, you can even use a laundry bag.  Since we are using both cloth and disposables, we have two!  The system works great and there is no noticeable smell (although our son is a breastfed baby, so smell is at a minimum anyway).  We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.  Make sure the velcro is fastened before turning the handle to dispose of the diaper (and make sure your husband does this as well!).  I have heard that you shouldn\'t dispose of loose wipes without putting them in the diaper first.  Since we are using cloth diapers, we often throw the disposable wipes in the disposable pail loose without a diaper and have had no problems so far!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"While the diaper champ is not perfect, it is really good! No special bags to buy! One hand diaper disposal and very easy to clean! I change the bag 2-3 times a week and before I put a new bag back in I use mr.clean and clean it up real good. No odors and really easy!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I\'ve worked with kids more than half my life. First as a babysitter /nanny and now as a mother. I\'ve used diaper genies and they\'ve all been really smelly. I never had to deal with changing cartridges but I can imagine how annoying it could be to open that stench-filled object and take out the poop sausage. I love my diaper champ. It\'s so easy to use. I never had a problem with it squishing my finger because I always remember that the lid is heavy. No smell escapes from it and I keep it in my bathroom. We\'ll see if I still love it once my DD\'s soiled diapers become stinky.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have owned a Diaper Dekor and now a Diaper Champ.  I prefer the Diaper Champ because it does not utilize expensive refills and it keeps the odor in better than the Diaper Dekor.  The Diaper Dekor broke, the arm that lifts the lid up broke off.  So I had to go searching for a new product again since they discontinued the model that I was using.  I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.  Let\'s face it, even the best can\'t keep in that smell, especially as your child gets older.  I have two children now, so the Diaper Champ is getting utilized quite a bit and it beats the competition hands down.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is much better than the Genie, it doesn\'t smell as bad if you take your trash out on a regular basis.  The only way I can keep it from smelling is to put a cloth wet with pine-sol in the bottom.  This generally works for 3 or 4 days. However, the capacity is not that great especially if you have twins!  (But what is except for a 33 gallon trash can with a hole in the top!)  The capacity is really the only thing I can complain about, even with one baby it seemed to fill up pretty fast.  It is convient, no twisting, turning, or shoving the diapers like you have to with the Genie.  And the use of any bag is great, too!  Although, it seems to tear everytime I change it.  Overall, for the price and for one baby, it\'s not too bad.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I researched all the available options and decided to try the Diaper Champ instad of diaper genie. It made diaper disposal a snap!! The one handed disposal was soo convenient when i was holding a squirmy baby with one arm. It is smell free if you empty frequently and almost so if you don\'t. This thing lived next to my sidetable for the first few months and often it was only emptied when it was full (its pretty large). I used some simple tricks to prevent smell leakage:-Rolled and taped up the diapers securely before disposing-Always returned the handle to original position so that only one side of the opening stayed in contact with smelly diapers (you\'ll know what i mean when you use it)-Used scented odor lock GLAD bags and aired out the champ between bag changesThe only cons I found were that opening it is a bit tough ( you get more adept at it though and its safer) and there is a small opening below the handle which is where the odor tends to escape when it does.The cons are pretty minor given how well this thing works AND it is cost effective...i hate the idea of being forced to buy brand specific refills. It may seem bulky and not great to look at but I have to admit i have at times emptied the champ only when it could not take a single more diaper. I almost returned this when i opened it and saw how large it was but i am so glad i kept it!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I love the Diaper Champ - it makes diaper changes quick and easy. We make sure to wrap up all the dirty wipes in the dirty diaper before depositing it, so it doesn\'t get stuck in the shoot. Each time the bag is full, we empty the pail, spray Lysol inside and out, and replace the bag. We\'ve had it for almost 3 months now, and can\'t complain.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This product has been great.  It\'s easy to use, holds plenty of dirty diapers, takes any kind of bag (this is important!), and does not take up too much space.Once in a while the drum gets stuck, but that\'s only when the pail is too full.Great product!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought this over the Genie because you could use regular kitchen bags and with a greater capacity you wouldn\'t have to change the bag as often.  I was wrong on the last point.  Because it doesn\'t keep odor in as well, you really still need to change the bag often.  This from a mom with a breastfed baby, and supposedly breastmilk diapers have less odor.  In addition, it is a little tricky to open and close the bin.  The blue insert that holds the bag in can be difficult to manipulate.  No big deal.  I am still glad we chose this over the Genie, all things considered.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.  I have emailed Baby Trend for a refund so I can go buy something else.  I am even nursing my daughter and the stench from her &quot;odorless&quot; pail is horrific.  I cannot believe they didn\'t make a space for a deodorizer.  I\'m pretty shocked at how bad it is!,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I don\'t think this pail really did everything I was expecting, which was based on the content they provided on their site.  I had a hard time opening and closing it, and honestly the smells containment was not any greater than a normal trash bin.  Cute design, but not worthy of higher expectations.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I had tried a Diaper Genie at a friend\'s house and wasn\'t really impressed with how it worked, not to mention the idea of having to buy refills.  I registered for the Diaper Champ primarily because you could use regular kitchen trash bags instead of special refills, and all the good reviews it seemed to get.  I could not be happier with the Champ!  It is truly the easiet thing in the world to use--one hand is all you need.  We have not noticed an odor problem at all.  Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can\'t imagine other systems aren\'t the same way.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone having a baby!  It is by far the best thing I received as a shower gift.  You won\'t be disappointed in the Champ!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This product was great for the first couple months.  It IS very easy to use, there\'s no twisting or struggling with the special bags, but when your little one starts foods and their mess gets a little more stinky, this pail does nothing to contain the odor.Here\'s the problem...there\'s no seal on the lid.  Where the lid opens to get the bags in and out, it\'s plastic against plastic that\'s not even remotely air tight that constantly leaks the stench of the inside.  Also, the chamber where you place the diaper gives you a waft of diaper pail air each time you flip it.I\'m realistic that it IS a diaper pail and is it going to smell, but this product could do a much better job.  I DO empty mine at least once a week, wipe it with disinfecting wipes, spray it with lysol and let it air out for at least one day before it goes back in her room.  The problem is, you just can\'t get to all the surfaces in the top of the pail.  I spend more time struggling with this thing, cleaning it, and airing it out than is realistic.Save your money on this one.  The cost of not having to buy the diaper genie bags is not worth smell in my little darling\'s nursery.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I nannied for two babies in some one else\'s home and they have the Diaper Champ. I think the reason parents don\'t smell the diapers when using this product is because they get used to the smell!! I would think that the poopy diapers were fine in this diaper pail until the parents would come home and ask why it smelled so bad in their house! Finally, I had to start using the ""champ"" for wet diapers only and walk the poopy diapers out to the street garbage can. Although I\'m sure that this is better than throwing the diapers in your house garbage, there has to be something with some better odor control!",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We did alot of research on diaper pails before our first child was born.  We knew a few couples with the Diaper Genie, and one couple with the Diaper Champ.  The couple with the Diaper Champ has a baby that is 3 months older than our child.  This couple liked their Champ just fine, saying they noticed no odors.  We also read tons of reviews, mainly here on Amazon, of both products.  And from the reviews, it seemed there were many happy customers of both products.  So we decided, if they were about equal, we would go with the more convenient and cheaper solution, the Champ.Well, we were pretty happy for about 4 to 6 months.  We very much liked that we could use our regular trash bags.  And changing the Champ\'s bag is very easy.  But after our child was well into eating solids, at about 7 months, the smell became unbearable.  It really is true that babies\' poops really start to stink much, much worse when they eat lots of solids.  So we went out and bought a Diaper Genie, and are now very happy with the Genie.  The Genie has 2 big advantages over the Champ, in regards to smell control.  1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie\'s twisting mechanism.  2)  The filler bags progress in thickness, so as your child gets older, and her poops get smellier, you can get thicker, better bags.After using the Genie for about a month now, we are very pleased.  The Champ is essentially a simple waste pail with a fancy hood.  The hood and ordinary trash bags don\'t do much for odor prevention.  The drawbacks to the Genie though, are that you must buy their fillers, and the bag changing mechanism is much more complicated than the Champ\'s.  We thought these were worth dealing with to prevent the odors.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We registered for the diaper champ after comparing it with the diaper genie and diaper dekor at the store.  We had used the diaper genie while working in the church nursery and found it to be extremely difficult to use with the number of diapers we were changing there.  Now our own baby is four months old, and we have loved having the diaper champ at home.  It is so easy to use and does not stink, or at least it hasn\'t yet.  We use Ruffies scented garbage bags and change the bag when full, about every five days.  I would definitely recommend the diaper champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I love this diaper pail!  It\'s so easy to use and I haven\'t had any problems with diaper odors.  I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.  Save yourself some money and hassle and buy the Diaper Champ!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I decided to buy this because we did not want to be tied down to any expensive refills. We are very happy with our decision. It is odorless, easy to operate and holds good amount of diapers.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The champ is great because you don\'t have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie.  This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).  I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that\'s inevitable!  Here\'s some tricks for this Champ:1.  Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.  And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don\'t expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.  The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.  If you\'re like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.  Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.  Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I just wanted to say that I love my Diaper Champ (I use it with my Fuzzi Bunz cloth diapers) and I have never had a problem with smell. I think it also makes a big difference whether or not you breastfeed or artificially feed. I only breastfeed so I never have a problem.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought the diaper champ, because we heard all the others where over priced, espeically with the refills. We liked how with the this diaper pail you could just use regular trash bags. It worked very well and we where very happy with our purchase until it started to get warmer out, and our son started to eat foods. It smells! We keep it in our son\'s closet with an air freshiner in it! It\'s good while they are young, right now i think any trash can would do the same.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have to agree with the other moms. At first the Diaper Champ was a champ, until I had to change the bag.  It is difficult to open, not to mention everytime I did change the bag my nails would break (and I don\'t have long ones).  My daughter is 19 months, still breast feeding and eating solids and let me tell you, her pooh stinks.  Once I decided to take the Diaper Champ out of the room and walk each diaper to the outside dumpster, it still took weeks for the smell to get out of the room.  It penetrated into the room.  Not to mention, one day, little tiny flies started growing inside.  I was changing the bag on an every day basis.  This is by far the worst product out there.  Take my word for it when I say, I rather take the walk and dump the diaper outside than have to use the Diaper Champ ever again.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I wanted a diaper pail that didn\'t stink. I\'d heard from *everyone* I knew that had purchased a Diaper Genie to not bother looking, nothing out there stopped the stink. ""Just take it outside right away"" was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did! I found this Diaper Champ - no refills - a definite plus - you just use your regular kitchen garbage bags. Convenient, and less costly!But the big question is - did it work? Did it keep the stink out of my baby\'s room?? I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES! It works!Now, if you hover right above the opening and inhale deeply, you will catch a whiff of poo. But who does that?? Sceptical friends who had owned the Diaper Genie (the ones who swore nothing would work!) were thrilled and a little jealous that this thing works so well!I\'ve never had an issue with ""skid marks"" as another reviewer posted - 11 months, skid free so far. I have had a seal loosen, as another reviewer mentioned, but as he said - it has not affected the odor prevention of this.Word of warning - it works so well that you will not be prepared for the odor you will get when you open this to change the bag. Hold your breath!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is the best thing ever. Easy to use and no need to buy expensive refills. I bought cheap trash bags and only have to replace it every 3-4 days. I also bought a stick up and placed inside so when I changed the bag the smell wasn\'t so bad. This is definately a product I would tell everyone to buy.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am one of those super-critical shoppers who researches everything about a product and then second-guesses purchase decisions...but I love this diaper pail.  I was completely satisfied with my purchase and even bought a second one for our upstairs bedroom.*It really is cost effective.  You don\'t have to spend money on refill bags.  I just use the pastic ones from the grocery store.  They work perfectly.*It is so easy to use, so easy to change.  I tried another brand of diaper pail and you had to push a button and flip a lid and push the diaper through...no.  You should spend zero time disposing of diapers and all your time with your new baby.  The Diaper Champ is effortless.*It effectively keeps the room from smelling like dirty diapers.  I live where it is hot and humid and don\'t have central air so smell containment is important.  It\'s not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.  Scented bags makes the whole room smell kind of nice if you have a super-sensitive nose.*At first I was turned off by the look of the diaper pail, but I have come to appreciate its design.  I bought and tried out a different one and found that the Diaper Champ is taller (about 27"" high) and narrower.  This means that it takes up less floor space but still holds quite a few diapers (I empty it every 2-3 days).  Also I don\'t have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.*A small but considerate detail--there is a foot around the bottom of the pail that you can hold down while you change the bag.  This along with the way the weight is centered in the design makes it so the whole thing doesn\'t fall over when you open it to change the bag.  The other brand I had tried kept falling over when I tried to change the bag and it was incredibly frustrating.*The only thing against the product I would mention is the noise.  It makes a ""thunk"" when you dispose a diaper into the pail.  I don\'t mind it during the day--it\'s actually kind of fun to use.  But during night-time changings you have to flip the handle a little slower so it doesn\'t make a noise.Anyways, I hope this helps.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this thing! I don\'t notice any smell while top shut. It is simple to use, simple to clean. The top does jam when the bag is full, but what else would you expect. I like that because then I know its time to change the bag.I don\'t know what I would do without this thing!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have had the Diaper Champ in my son\'s room for 6 months and all of a sudden the room smells like dirty diapers all the time.  The smell is starting to linger down the hall.  I cleaned the diaper champ, let it air out over night and then sprayed it with lysol and it is still stinking up the room!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have been using a d. champ for nearly four years now - it has been very convenient, easy to use, and as close to odorless as one could reasonably hope.  We bought it for our son, and when his little sister was born, we bought a different one because the store we were in didn\'t have a champ.  When my son learned to use the toilet, we got rid of the new one and moved the champ into my daughter\'s room.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We heard bad stories about the diaper genie and decided to go on a recommendation for the ""Champ.""  Boy, are we glad we listened. I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.  Definitely worth the investment and very easy to use - especially in the middle of the night.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this product. It is so easy to use and there are no refills. I can use any kind of kitchen bag. There is a smell of course when you change the bag, but it is no big deal, it is just until you tie up the bag.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My daughter is about to turn 2 and I am starting to potty train her, so it is time to sell my Diaper Champ at our next yard sale.  I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.  After they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor.  Do not buy this if you are looking to avoid diaper smell--you will probably be disappointed, especially since this product costs about $30.  What I\'m currently doing is what other reviewers have said--I just put the dirty diapers in with the kitchen garbage since that gets taken out frequently.  (No, my kitchen garbage is not actually in the kitchen, it\'s on the other side of a safety gate in the adjoining laundry room.  Those of you with toddlers understand I\'m sure.)You know what IS nice about this diaper pail though?  It keeps your kid out of the dirty diapers. When my daughter started getting into everything, at least I didn\'t have to worry about her getting into the nasty diapers and doing anything with them.I don\'t think this product is worth $30.  It\'s essentially a plastic garbage can with a nifty lid.  It should probably cost half what it does.  If you get this, try using the plastic grocery store bags and taking them out more often.I want to add one last thing for those parents that don\'t know--a lot of parents aren\'t emptying poo from diapers into the toilet before throwing away the disposable diaper.  This is something you are supposed to do, not just for cloth diapers.  That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade. I realize this takes some of the convenience out of it being a disposable diaper, but it is something we all need to be doing.  It\'ll also help cut down on the diaper stink of course.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This thing doesn\'t work very well. It still smells up the room. I\'ve found the only way to not have smelly diapers around is to throw them in a grocery bag, tie it up and put it outside. It\'s cheaper too.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have used our diaper champ for the last 7 months and it is great. It doesn\'t stink, it is easy to change bags, and you can use any bags you like.  I use our standard kitchen garbage bags.  I have tried the diaper genie and hated it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This product is nice in theory but not all that its cracked up to be.  The foam lining comes out after several months of use (this happened to 3 other people I know too), and it does nothing to stop odor.  (If you peek around the latch, you can see that there is open circulation into the diaper bag where odors flow freely).  Save your money and buy something else - this champs a chump.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Got this for my baby shower, after reading all the reviews.  I have never had a problem with mine.  I uses odor controlling garbage bags, and you never smell any dirty diapers.This product is great!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,It does contain most of the odors but not all.  It is however a huge hassle to open so beware if you value your manicures.  It will save you money on refills so that\'s a plus.,3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My baby is now 8 months and the can has been helpful.  I think it\'s great to make sure the really smelly ones are sealed, especially if I can\'t run to dump the trash outside.  I do usually bag the really bad ones, so I don\'t dirty the the entry.  It\'s also great now that the baby is crawling.  She can easily knock over a trash can, but the Diaper Champ is much heavier and she hasn\'t been able to get into it.  I doubt she will be able to get into it even when she is older.The bags are easily replaceable and affordable, far more than other options.  My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.  My friends liked my choice.You do have to empty the Diaper Champ can and clean it, but since it holds some pretty toxic trash, I would recommend that with any disposal system.  I\'m extremely satisfied.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Have had no problems with this! We use regular scented trash bags & empty out twice a week. No issues with smells, but we keep it in the bathroom and use scented trash bags so that may help. We used the diaper genie with our first baby & this one is considerably much better. Good price too!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Over the past several years, I have babysat for many different families.  In every home where there was a child in diapers, there was a Diaper Genie.  Recently, I had my first child, and I decided to try the Diaper Champ instead.  I am so glad that I did. I find it much simpler to use than the genie, and I have had no problems with odors.(I don\'t think this should be an issue if the bag is replaced every few days.)  It is also nice being able to use any garbage bag instead of having to purchase special bags.  I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the Diaper Champ and I plan to get another one!  I have one in the baby\'s room and I\'d like another one for downstairs next to her pack \'n play (since it has a changing table on it).  I feel like it keeps odors in as long as you do what other people suggested such as every time you take out a bag, spray and air out for a couple minutes and then replace with a new bag.  Also, I always make sure that I roll up each diaper securely before putting it in the diaper champ.  We only have to empty ours about every 2 weeks right now (our baby is 11 weeks old) because I change her downstairs half of the time.I really like the fact that you can use your own trash bags.  What a cost saver.  No special bags, no twisting (like the diaper genie), no tying special knots in the bags, no buying refills... as you can see I don\'t like the genie one bit.  As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.  Think of someone who comes to watch your baby - the diaper champ is so easy and they\'ll almost never have to change the bag for you.  That diaper genie was always full when I was babysitting.  Ugh!The only reason I gave this four instead of five stars, was because you can easily break your nails trying to open it up to replace the bag (the first time I did, despite the warnings!).  And the lid doesn\'t stay open for you to air it out unless you prop it open... but that\'s only for a few mintues anyways.  I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.  Speaking of hands, you only need one hand to throw away that messy diaper too!I highly recommend the diaper champ - in fact, I\'m buying another one today!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the convenience of not having to worry about special bags, that\'s why I rated this so high. However, when I first started using this diaper pail, the velcro from my daughter\'s diapers was getting stuck on something inside the lid.  Needless to say, getting the diapers unstuck was disgusting.  Once I yanked out the fabric that the diapers were getting stuck on, I really liked the diaper pail.  The dirty diapers still stink, so I put each dirty diaper in its own sack and throw them out in the kitchen garbage so that they go out every night.  Now my house never stinks like a dirty diaper.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We love this diaper pail.  I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.  The Diaper champ is easy to use single-handed, and is tall enough so you don\'t have to bend over much to use it.  We found it contains even the stinkiest diapers well, and can fit quite a few in there.  By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.  The plunger can make a loud \'thud\' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.  It doesn\'t seem to bother the baby, but I don\'t want to take any chances!  The other pail we use is very inferior.  It takes 2 hands to operate, is very short and doesn\'t contain the smell well.  We would buy the diaper champ for any of our friends having babies.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I got one of these and a diaper genie for gifts. I decided to try them both out and see which I liked better. The diaper champ defintly won! I love not having to buy refills, my regular trash bags work just fine. It completly hides odors and is very easy to clean and use. It also holds more then the genie.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is one great diaper pail.  I cannot smell any diapers in my son\'s room.  It\'s easy to use.  Cheap to keep in trash bags.  And holds a week\'s worth of diapers.  Trash day we just empty it and out to the trash it goes.  Yeah for the Diaper Champ!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is a great for dirty Diapers. I have had no problem with smells. And it is easy to empty out. I love It!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"If you wrap up the diaper with the tape, it keeps the smell out just fine.  Also, because you can use any bags with the Champ, we used some cheap eucalyptus smelling bags and it\'s a lot cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was a diaper genie user until my son was about 1 month old.  I thought that it was hard to use.  We had a friend tell us about the Diaper CHAMP and told us to try it out.  The name say\'s it all.  Our son is now almost 2 years old.  We just quit using the diaper champ about 3 months ago just because it was just as easy to carry them out to the trash.  We have had no problems at with the diaper champ at all.  It does a great job on keeping the odor in the pail.  Sure, it smells when you change the bag, but you just seal off the bag, and smell is gone.  NO refills to buy or anything.  ITs great.  ITs a breeze to clean and empty the bag.  This is way better than the diaper genie!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have been using this diaper pail for 41/2 months now and just love it. It is taller than other diaper pails so you don\'t have to bend so far down to dispose of the diaper AND you can use regular kitchen garbage bags.  I didn\'t want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.  My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don\'t know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!  I am very happy with it and would gladly recommend it, especially if you are the least bit tall.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star..... Please don\'t buy this one!,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We like our diaper champ because you don\'t have to buy special bags and it let\'s you know when it\'s full.  We don\'t have any smell in our babies room, and she poops a lot.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a great diaper pail, easy to use and keeps the odor in. It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don\'t need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie. It is also very user friendly in that you only need one hand, just drop in the diaper flip the handle over and you\'re done.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I paid $39.99 for this on Amazon and could have bought it in the store for $29.99.  WAY too overpriced!  I wish I had researched a little more.,2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Daiper Champ is a true champion. Earlier i was planning to buy Diaper Genie as i had liked its innovative style. However, all my friends were sick and tired of its refill system. Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food. It also need some assembly while as CHAMP is so easy to use and can take any size diaper, any trash bag and even a kid can handle it with ease.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the best diaper pail.  I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven\'t noticed any odors since we\'ve been using it.  I highly recommend this product to everyone!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I LOVE this diaper pail!  Just buy regular kitchen trash bags! I haven\'t found a pail yet that\'s completely odorless, but this one is the best!  And my daughter can\'t get into it and pull the diapers out!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ is excellent.  I have experienced no issues with odor, in fact I keep this in my baby\'s closet.  No special bags are needed ... what a savings!  Just a spray of Lysol in between bag changes and everything smells rosy!  Great value for an excellent product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'m not sure about this one.  In concept, it\'s a fabulous idea.  I love that you don\'t have to purchase expensive refills.  I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.  The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.  In addition, I don\'t believe that it is odorless.  My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor...I\'m concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.  If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We like this diaper pail.  I\'ve had two others with our older kids--one a diaper genie (which I personally found to be a pain) and another by fisher price that I don\'t know if they still  make.We used this for all diapers for the first six months, until our baby started having solid food.  As an exclusively breast fed baby, there were no odors escaping at all.  (Formula fed babies have stinkier diapers, so I don\'t personally know if it would be as efficient for them.)  My older two actually enjoyed putting the diaper in.  It\'s easy to change out.  I always opened it up outside (if you try to open it inside there will be some odors escape), pulled out the full bag, sprayed the can with lysol, and kept a dryer sheet in the bottom which I changed every month or so.Now that little one is having solids, I personally don\'t expect any diaper pail to contain the smell, so I put dirty ones directly outside.  We still use it for the wet ones.  It has worked out fine because at this point he only has one messy diaper a day.I had a little trouble with the adhesive on the gasket thingee coming loose, but I emailed them and they very promptly sent me a new one for free, along with a few extras in case it happened again (which it hasn\'t), so I think the customer service is good.The only thing I don\'t like about it is that you have to empty it fairly often, but I also recognize that honestly that\'s ridiculous on my part.  The more it holds, the more room it takes up, the heavier it gets, etc.  And the fact that you can\'t go more than two or three days (as a newborn, anyway) is probably one of the reasons it contains the smell.  The longer they sit, the more rank they get.  Now that he\'s older and doesn\'t go through 15 diapers a day, I only change it about once a week.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I bought the Diaper Champ because it was recommended to us over the Diaper Genie.  2 weeks after using it we decided it wasn\'t for us.  It didn\'t hold the smells in AT ALL! Tried using scented garbage bags and that didn\'t help! Our room still stunk! I bought the Diaper Genie and while it does\'t keep the smells in 100% (you can still smell it when you open it to put another diaper in) and you have to buy the refill bags, it works a lot better than the Diaper Champ and the room smells a lot better than it did before.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ was recommended to us in the Babies R Us asile by a nanny who was picking up one for one of the households that she was working with.  She loved her previous experience with the product, and we are glad that she spoke up to recommend it to us.Pluses: It is a LOT easier to use than the Diaper Genie (for example you can throw a diaper away with just one hand!  Woo-hoo!)  Also, you can use regular kitchen trash bags inside it, so you don\'t have to buy special bags at an inflated price.  Further, due to it\'s extra large containment area you don\'t have to take out the trash as often as you would have to with the smaller Diaper Genie and the smell seems to stay inside just fine. :)The one minus that I experienced: According to the directions that came in the box, you can take apart the drum/piston assembly if you should wish to thoroughly clean the inside of it.  When we first bought the Diaper Genie I tried to take it apart.  I *could not* get it to come apart, nor could my husband.  It would not BUDGE-so much so that if the directions didn\'t specifically mention that it could be separated I would have assumed that it was not built to come apart.  After trying to get it apart for a ridiculous amount of time, (using practically everything from my nails to a crowbar,) I finally broke down and called the customer service number to see if I was missing some key- a button or lever to push- anything!  The customer service person told me to ""try harder"", then call again if I couldn\'t get it open!(Insert long pause with upraised eyebrows here.)Needless to say, I thought that was a bit less than helpful.  So... maybe my Diaper Genie was warped, or maybe they are all impossible to get open- it\'s your gamble.  I didn\'t take it back to the store because I assume that they are all that way.  On the bright side, I really haven\'t felt that it\'s gotten dirtier than a lysol wipe could handle- so despite that lack of helpfulness that the customer service folks could offer me, I would still recommend the product itself to a friend.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I went to Babies R Us to buy a diaper genie, but instead were intrigued by the diaper champ... the store was sold out, the worker said we should have them hold one for us because they sell out as soon as they get them on the shelves... I can see why!  I have already referred about 5 of my friends to buying one.  We live in a small house, and if something stinks in one room, it will stink up the entire house, so we are so glad to have something that really works for those dirty diapers!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Well, the first three months were odor free!!  Then after the charcoal chamber absorbed all the odor - watch out.  After the3rd month, it was intolerable!!  I am going out tomorrow to purchase the diaper genie or something better!!!  No matter how much you clean or how often you spray with Lysol the smell keepscoming back.  And they don\'t have a website to complain too!",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am the mother of 9 children and this is the easiest diaper pail I have ever used.  It captures odors and it uses regular trash can liners so I don\'t have to buy any custom can liners, which saves me money and time.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My friends think I am strange, but I have to show my Diaper Champ off to anyone that comes in my house:) I recieved a diaper genie as a gift when I had my daughter three years ago and hated it. When I got pregnant this time, I decided to try something different. The Diaper Champ works great and I am saving tons of money not having to buy special bags. My 3 year old loves to turn the handle for me after I change the infant - some of my adult friends can\'t even figure out how to turn the Diaper Genie!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Unlike others, the Diaper Champ uses standard trashbags -- saving you headaches from trying to find the right bag and money because you don\'t have to buy a bag that only works in the Champ.  The Champ uses a wonderfully simple design to keep out odors and won\'t break.  The best part is that it is a full-sized can, which means you have to empty it less often.  The one drawback about not smelling dirty diapers is when you go to empty the Champ -- take it outside before you open it!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Love the Diaper Champ.  I had planned to get the Diaper Genie, but after I read the reviews, the Diaper Champ won out!  I love the fact that the Diaper Champ accepts any kind of bag, and you don\'t have to purchase specific bags.  That\'s way too much of a headache and expense that I don\'t need.  It\'s also super easy to use one-handed which is important with a squirmy infant either in your arms or on the changing table.  It took me a few minutes to learn how to change the bag, but that, too, is easy once you figure it out.  We haven\'t had a problem at all with the smell, but we do wipe it out with Clorox wipes every so often just to make sure.  This is one of those baby items I wouldn\'t want to do without.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The diaper wipes get stuck in the mechanism, making it unable to properly flip over. (edited, one year later to report:)I recently stopped using this item because the baby\'s room started to smell like urine, etc, after a few days. It didnt block the smell of the diapers. I am not sure diaper pails can really DO such a thing, but if they can, then this product isnt doing it\'s job. I started putting each diaper in a ziploc bag before throwing it away in this Diaper Champ, hoping that it would take away the stench of old diapers...no such luck. Now I just take the diaper with me and throw it away outside or in the main kitchen trash that gets taken out each night. I would take away my three stars and give two or onw, but I can\'t change what I put originally.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"A great product that works as promised.  I haven\'t had any problems with it accumulating odor, but I have a friend who did. I went to look at his and picked it up, it felt like it weighed 50 pounds! Folks, ya gotta empty it every few days, it can do only so much. The only con against it vs. the genie is that you should wrap the diaper tightly or the delivery chute will get soiled.  Other than that, it blows the genie away.  BUY IT.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We are using the Diaper Champ with our first baby and we love it!!  We don\'t have a problem with odors because we keep a roll of diaper disposer bags (little roll of blue plastic bags with a yellow duck dispenser) nearby in the changing table to put the smelly diapers in - this keeps everything clean and the blue bags are extremely economical to purchase (maybe $3 for 50 bags).  A small price to pay for an almost odorless diaper pail - we only use them for poopy diapers, not for wet-only diapers so they last for quite a while.  The bag in the Diaper Champ still gets changed 1 - 2 times per week because it\'s full, not because it\'s smelly.  This method also keeps the chamber and plunger free of messes.  Since the Diaper Champ can be used with any garbage bag, it\'s one less thing to have to remember when shopping and changing the bag is so simple and quick, it\'s easier than changing our kitchen garbage bag.  We have relatives who are expecting babies and will be sure to encourage them to register for the Diaper Champ.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ not only holds bombs, it is the bomb.  We used it for out first child 3 years ago, and are now using it for our new twins.  Holds in the odors so well, that even grandma occasionally makes a deposit herself!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have been using the Diaper Champ for the past three months. It holds lots of diapers and you can stuff it full. I have not smelled any bad odor coming from the pail in my son\'s room. It is easy to change a new bag, but I would suggest doing it outside. Once you open it up the smell does escape quickly. But, just give a quick wipe with a disenfectant cloth and put in your own garbage bag and you are ready to put it back in the room. I am very happy to have this diaper pail. I recommend it.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We love our diaper champ, and are so glad that a friend tipped us off to it. We had the diaper genie on our registry, but someone suggested that we get this instead--because we would save on bags. You can put any small size garbage bag in it- our local Target sells a pack of 90 for 1.99. Plus, from my babysitting days, I remember DiaperGenie being a little hard to use/empty. The diaper champ is easy, just throw the diaper in and flip! If you are trying to choose between the two, I\'d go for the Champ.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"THis thing works!  There were 3 baby cousins born 2 weeks apart in our family, I have the Diaper Champ and the other 2 have Diaper Genies -- I am the only one using my diaper pail. They quit using theirs in a few weeks because of the smells.  They both feed formula and only have one poopy diaper a day, so they immediately remove it from the house. My baby is breastfed and has poopy diapers at most diaper changes and this Diaper Champ diaper pail has been up to the task so far, he is 8 weeks old.  Outside is easy to wipe down with clorox disinfectant, since sometimes the cylinder gets a little runny stuff on it if I don\'t wrap them up tight enough. When it  doesn\'t want to turn and drop all the way down, then that\'s when I know it needs changed. It\'s nice not to have to buy special bags too!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this product because you can use REGULAR TRASH BAGS and you do not need to order ""refill bags"" to keep this unit operational!  It\'s easy to use, blocks all odors, and once you pay for the unit, there are no additional bags to buy...which saves you money in the long run!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this diaper Champ. I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends. This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends. As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change). I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud. Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This was my 3rd diaper pail with my 3rd baby.  This one was by far the best one and the easiest to use. You can use your own bags, which makes it a plus over the Diaper Genie.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I originally bought the Diaper Genie when my son was born. It broke when he turned 9 months so I bought another Diaper Genie. However, the Diaper Genie became very smelly as my son got older and onto solids. I decided to switch to the Champ and I think it\'s much better at handling odors. It also holds a lot of diapers. Not having to purchase special bags is a plus. Now, I agree with others that there is probably nothing out there that truly gets rid of odors, but I think the Champ does a good job. Just make sure the tape of the diaper is not exposed when you throw your diaper in the Champ and try and empty it as often as possible. My son is now 12 months and after 2 Diaper Genies and a Champ, I highly recommend the Champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I had a cheap safety 1st pail and hated it. It fell apart and did not keep down on the stench AT ALL. I read a ton of reviews and thought...&quot;hmm  the diaper dekor sounds the best&quot;. However, I really did not want to deal with buying special bags and all that (plus the pail itself was more expensive). I know I didn\'t want the genie, so I tried the Champ. Since I have not tried the Dekor, I can not really say which is better. But the Champ is easy to use, inexpensive, and keeps down on the bad odors. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS (especially for people who are not rich and dont want to spend the time and effort finding and buying special bags)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"my son is now 3 months old and when he was born i didnt have a diaper pail.  well after reading the reviews i decided to go with the diaper champ. let me tell you, the only time it smells is when its full or you open it to change the bag, after that with a fresh bag, there are no disgusting smells. i love this pail and i dont have to worry about forgetting about needing refils and running out at 3 a.m. because i can use my tall kitchen bags! my 3 year old enjoys helping me change the baby because he likes to flip the handle.  this was my best investment for the baby!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It stinks - we lysol ours 2-3 times a week. Diapers get jammed and it hardly holds any. We are better off buying a flip garbage can lid for like $6 bucks. Same idea without the headache and the ""diaper pail"" look.The only good thing with this one is you can use any garbage bag you want.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We got this for our newborn, and within the first two weeks of use, the liner (that I assume is supposed to keep odor in) fell out because it got caught on one of the stickies on the diaper. This pail doesn\'t really keep in odors anymore and we\'ll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I recieved this pail as a gift and loved the idea that it didn\'t require specifc refills packages. You can use any plastic garbage bag! It\'s easy to use and convienient. One minor detail is you don\'t know when it\'s full until you can\'t turn the handle any  more, but that\'s a small price to pay for this wonderful product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I am glad I bought this! It uses regular garbage bags and there is no odor at all. It is so easy to use. Thumbs up on this one. I am glad I didnt get the diaper genie..it wouldve been a waste of money!I recommend this diaper champ to everyone!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Its a good product because its easy to use, and you don\'t need the expensive refillable bags like the Diaper Genie.  However, it doesn\'t do so good of a job hiding the smell.  We\'d spray the inside with Lysol disenfectant, but if we waited for the bag to fill up to capacity our room would be full of the dirty diaper smell.  So that\'s the only reason I give it a 4 stars.Its easy to use, and inexpensive when it comes to the refills.  Just doesn\'t mask the smell of dirty diapers that well.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"this works really well.  I found it easier than diaper gienie and you can drop in the diaper and dispose with one hand.  To keep odor down you need to change before it gets too full, couple times a week  or more often if have a couple poopy diapersYou also can use any bags.  I have one on each floor of my home.Also keeps the dogs from getting the diapers.  occasionally a diaper will get stuck but that is usually when it is getting too full.  Only prob I have found is when I push on the lever to open to change the bag it is kind of difficult to unlatch and have broken a nail on it a few times- no biggie, kind of annoying.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This truly is the champ of diapers. This product, unlike the genie and others, is standalone of ""refills"" (well, you do need garbage bags, but you should already have those). It also does a very good job of keeping the stink away. Not once has the smell came out in such a way that we notice.It also kind of reminds me of the ghost jail thing in Ghostbusters, you know, where they put the trap in and release the ghosts?It\'s a great product. It\'s kind of big, it\'s well made, and it will not need to be changed out for about a week. I\'d advise anyone to buy it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'ve read all of the reviews of those of you who can\'t understand why the rest of us hated our Diaper Champs, and I just have to say-give it a while, you\'ll find out. We bought our Diaper Champ when our first son was born. For pretty much  the first year we LOVED it. Everyone is right, you don\'t have to spend money on seperate bags, it\'s a nice height so you don\'t have to bend over it and it\'s really easy to use. I think it takes about a year though, or maybe even a little longer, and it will start to reek so bad that you\'ll want to sleep at the neighbors house just to escape the smell. For all of you who haven\'t used yours long enough-just wait, it will happen. We scrubbed ours with bleach, we emptied it daily, we aired it out in the backyard for two days, and then we finally started putting every single diaper in ziplock bags before putting them in the diaper champ (so much for no extra bags!). NOTHING helped. I\'m not stupid, I understand that when it comes to diapers, nothing is smell proof. We emptied it all the time and disinfected it constantly. But I\'m not talking normal stinky diaper smell. I\'m talking the combined smell of every stinky diaper in the entire world. It was SO BAD. Unless you plan on potty training your child when he turns one, and good luck with that, you\'ll probably end up replacing yours before the diaper days are over. In the end we bought a Diaper Genie. We\'ve used it for two years now and have had no problems. It kinda stinks a little when you open it, but the smell stays in there when it\'s closed. I\'ll buy seperate bags any day if I never have to smell that foul Diaper Champ again.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I see that there are complaints of stinkiness regarding this unit, but short of hermetic sealing, you\'re gonna be dealing with poo smell. I think a bit of odor is a fair trade-off for the ability to use normal trash bags and not be locked into yet another system of expendables. (See Braun shaver cleaning cartridges, etc.) The unit relies on a fairly tight seal between the bag (where it passes through the dark blue plastic holder) and the ""funnel"" bottom on the underside of the top portion. If the bag installation is somewhat off this would probably lead to a poor to non-existent seal.That said, the design of the unit is pretty clever - the piston and gravity work to deposit the diaper into the bag in one fell swoop as the handle is rotated through a 180-degree arc, without any hazardous poking of fingers in the vicinity of fresh poo.  That the lid latch is not immediately easy to pop open can be seen as a feature - keeping the contents safe from rude dogs who knock over trash for the goodies inside.  All told it seems to work very well.",5
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"I bought this pillow a month ago, and have been sleeping great ever since! I am 5 months pregnant, and had been sleeping with a regular pillow under my belly until i purchased this product. I am petite so i was always having to lift my belly to set it on the regular pillow, and i could feel my round ligaments cramping up. I haven\'t woken up with discomfort or pain since using this pillow! It keeps me from rolling on my back and is very comfortable to sleep on. I don\'t have any complaints with this product. However, i can see how it could be a problem for someone who tosses and turns at night, or for someone on the larger side, it may have enough back support.",5
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"I love this pillow. I just bought it &amp; am finding that it keeps me on my side where I belong. Being a back sleeper is tough when you aren\'t able to do so. I only gave four stars because I still have lots of back pain, but hopefully I will lose it with more pillow use. I wish I\'d bought it LONG ago!",4
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"Although I\'m not extremely big yet, I wanted to try to get a pillow so I could get used to sleeping on my side (I\'m normally a back sleeper).I\'m in my 4th month and just bought this pillow. The first couple nights, I tried it as the picture suggested.  But I found that it wasn\'t staying the way it was supposed to, and it just wasn\'t comfortable.Then, a couple of nights ago, I just took the larger of the two wedges, and put that behind my back as I laid on my side.  I made sure my shoulder was comfortable, by adding an extra pillow under my head.  And ever since I tried this configuration, I have been sleeping much better. I think this is working for me, because since I am a back sleeper normally, this kind of feels similar to what I\'m used to, with the wedge on my back.Also, the past month or so, I\'ve been waking up with pretty bad lower back pain, but ever since I started using the wedge behind my back, I have had almost no back pain.I would recommend this to anyone who is having trouble sleeping on their side and/or is waking up with back pain.",4
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"This pillow helps to support the growing belly, but I really bought it for my aching back.  The back support is minimal at best - it doesn\'t stop me from rolling over to my back nor provide a cushion of support to lean my back up against when I am tired of putting my full weight on my left side.  I have had this product for about 2-3 months, and now use it only about 1-2 nights per week.  But for the price, it is better then nothing.",3
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"By the time I actually purchased this, around my eighth month, I was already used to sleeping on my side.  The problems I was having of basic discomfort and pain when sleeping were not helped by this product.  If I wanted to move at all I had to wrestle with it to move it and I still hurt all the time.  I guess by that point nothing would have helped.  It might be useful if you buy it very early on, though.",2
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,I felt a complete difference the very first night I slept with the pregnancy wedge.  I regret not purchasing this sooner.  It truly makes a difference in our sleep - and we diffently need our sleep!  After the baby comes you can use it to prop the baby\'s head/body up when he/she is ill - another wonderful use.  This is a must buy and a great deal.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","My son is 18 months old, and I have been using this sheet for over a year (I now have 2 of them). This is a wonderful item for parents who don\'t have the patience for constantly changing a fitted crib sheet when baby\'s diaper leaks (and we all know this happens no matter what we do). I have read the warnings about babies getting stuck under the sheet, and while I agree that this is very dangerous, I have never had a problem with mine. I did have to exchange a sheet recently, however, because the elastic pieces and the snaps were sewn too close together, which made the sheet bunch up in several places &amp; not lay flat in the crib. I noticed that many of the sheets are sewn this way. Other than that, I highly recommend this crib sheet.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",We got 2 of these sheets as a gift and I feel sorry for the person who bought them. They don\'t stand up to any kind of washing and they\'re still dangerous. My wife and I finally gave up and made our own sheets that are much much safer. They\'re like larger pillow cases that fit over the entire mattress. Little more trouble to put on but our son can\'t get wrapped up in them no matter what.,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I had high hopes for this product, anything to make our lives easier, especially for crib changes in the middle of the night.  However, I had to return this product for multiple reasons.  First, it does not attach properly to my crib.  I have a standard size crib, which a standard mattress fits in just fine (very snug) however the elastic loops do not attach to my crib rails correctly, so there are either loose elastic pieces that the baby could find and chew on, or it\'s stretch funny across the crib leaving lumps of fabric in the way, either way it\'s not appropriate.  Second, it\'s extremely hot. If you have a warm body baby, (s)he will be sweating in minutes laying on this thing.  Our little boy would be on it for less than five minutes then be screaming because he was so hot.  We have central air in the house, so it wasn\'t because the house in general was too hot. We had trouble moving him from his pack n play to his crib for weeks, until we realized that this layer could be the issue.  As soon as we removed it, he was perfectly content to sleep in his crib.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Love this. We keep several layers on the crib mattress: mattress pad/protector, sheet, then ultimate crib sheet. In case of nighttime accidents or illness of any sort, I can just pull the ultimate crib sheet off, have another sheet ready to go, and mattress is always protected. Deducted one star b/c both of our ultimate crib sheets balled up immediately with first wash. Not as bad with second sheet since actually followed washing directions, but still had some pilling of soft layers.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","It\'s kind of weird to be putting a cover over your crib sheet (and never having to change the crib sheet), but these were a lifesaver after my daughter started leaking poop like crazy overnight.  Changing the crib sheet daily was NOT fun.After I got this, it got a bit easier.  It\'s not super fast to unsnap and snap on, but better than replacing the crib sheet (esp given I have a mobile that gets in the way of taking the mattress out).I have 3 of these so I don\'t have to immediately wash the dirty one.Only con is that the material seems a little rough.  Not as soft as the crib sheet fabric, unfortunately.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I purchased two of these sheets for myself before our baby was born, and also one for a friend\'s baby after I had tried them for myself. These sheets are great. I first used it on my bed before baby was born just in case my water broke while I was in bed...which did happen! And the sheets protected my mattress and bedding beautifully. The same in my baby\'s crib. I also use the sheets on the floor when baby plays on the floor (on top of a softer blanket). The ultimate crib sheet is basically a soft sheet on one side, a rubbery backing with something soft in between the two. All the bedding you\'d probably put on the crib mattress but all sew together as one unit. Washes easily. I\'d get two, one for the wash, one for the crib. I use one brightly colored fitted sheet on the crib mattress under the ultimate crib sheet just to give a little bit of a decorative look to the crib since the ultimate crib sheets I have are plain white. I recommend this product and will be using again myself in the future.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have been using these sheets for 6 months.  I have two Ultimate Crib Sheets, and when my 6 month old has diaper leaks or blowouts while sleeping, I can easily switch to the new ultimate sheet.  They are machine washable and dryer safe, which I LOVE, considering I am doing baby laundry multiple times a week.  Putting regular sheets on crib mattresses is a huge hassle, so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is a huge help for middle of the night diaper leaks.  It takes me much less time to switch these out than to change the whole sheet.  I leave baby\'s cute sheets on the mattress and use this on top.Size: Both of mine shrank a tiny bit in the dryer, but it is not a problem at all.  They fit flat on top of a regular crib-size mattress.Material:  The top side is a breathable, soft cotton layer.  The bottom side has a soft, waterproof plastic feel.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Hi - In concept this is a great idea, but I want to make sure people know about certain limitations.  Because of the placement of the securing straps, this sheet CANNOT be used on convertible cribs with a solid headboard.  You must have slats on all 4 sides of the crib - or be handy with a needle and thread.Just want to make sure people know, as these sheets are expensive and I was very disappointed to learn that I am unable to use them.",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Neat idea.  Although, I thought it was boring, so I wanted to put my sheets over it.  Well, it\'s not possible with the straps.  So, I have my sheets over it and it\'s not attached with its straps.  I never thought of leaving the sheets on underneath it to show through the sides until I read a review just now.  Perhaps if this was offered in colors as well as just white, it would be less boring.",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I don\'t know how I would have managed without these! My  twin boys wet through diapers like crazy, and these sheets are a huge time saver... just snap them out, wash & dry and snap them back on. They are really soft too.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","works great to keep the mattress and sheets under dry.  It also is good enough to be used without a cover, my daughter doesnt mind it.  Its practical and good for the money paid, recommended.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","The first night we had our daughter sleep in her crib, we had to change her sheet in the middle of the night.  Needless to say, after my husband wrestled the mattress out of the crib and the sheet off the mattress, he was beside himself!  I ordered 2 of these ultimate crib sheets the next day.  They are a snap (literally) to change, and every nursery needs at least one.  Save yourself the midnight wrestling match with the mattress when you need to change the sheet - and go with the Ultimate!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I used these with my second child, and plan to purchase some for my next child.  They are so simple to use, and make those inevitable middle of the night changes so easy.  I used mine over the top of the decorative sheet (so the mattress would be covered), and therefore only needed to change the decorative sheet once in a while.  Very handy, since I had to wrestle the mattress out of the crib to get the regular sheet off!  It also snaps securely so the baby cannot pull it off.  I would recommend this product to everyone!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I purchased the Ultimate Crib Sheet for a baby gift. I\'m that crazy about this product. Like all of my favorite baby items (my babies are now almost 10 and almost seven), the crib sheet was a gift from a friend who too, loved it. You put your regular crib sheet down on the bed (the fitted one). This one snaps in over the fitted sheet, around the rungs of the crib. If your child poops/pees/vomits in the middle of the night, all you have to do is unsnap the top sheet (it\'s got a leak proof backing on it) and then you\'ve already got your regular sheet underneath, ready to go. No fighting with the mattress in the middle of the night. Getting a fitted sheet on the mattress is hard enough during the day; doing it when your child has other issues going on is a nightmare. This really is the ""Ultimate"".",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",I love the Ultimate Crib Sheet - we\'ve been using it since our 22 month old was born.  You don\'t have to constantly lift up the crib mattress and fight to get sheets on.  It works very well and is a great time saver.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Buy 2 of these, so you can have a clean one ready while you do laundry.Usually, I write Good Things and Bad Things, but I have no complaints - so this time, only Good Things!Good Things:1) Easy to get on and off.2) Soft cotton top over waterproof bottom.3) You can put your \'cute\' sheets underneath, and really never have to change them, because they never get dirty. So you only need 1 set of pricey sheets if looks are your concern.4) What else do you need out of a crib sheet? :)",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",This is by far one of the best products that we purchased for our baby!  I would recommend that any new mom buy at least two of these sheets.  They make middle-of-the-night accidents so much easier to deal with!  Simply unsnap to remove the dirty sheet and snap on a clean one.In a market where there are so many useless and difficult products available (and as a first time parent you feel obligated to buy them all!) this is a little ray of sunshine!  Too bad all baby products are not this simple and wonderful for parents to use.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I just recommended this item to a relative who is expecting.  In thinking about it, I realized that I have had the same 2 Ultimate Crib Sheets in continuous use with 2 children for over 7 years now!  What a time saving device!  It comes off in seconds--no fumbling around at 2 am trying to change a dirty crib sheet.  Crib mattresses fit very snugly in a crib, so it is very difficult to change them; especially with a bumper on.I also think that this is real safety device.  As your crib sheets are washed and shrink they tend to slip off more easily which we all know is a suffocation hazard for baby.  With this Crib Sheet on top of a regular sheet, you don\'t have to worry about the fitted sheet slipping off. It has also allowed me to buy only one really EXPENSIVE designer sheet which I use underneath.  It has never had to be washed and looks as beautiful (and expensive!) as the day I bought it!  I wish I had invented this product!!!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I\'m glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","When my son was a newborn, I was able to fold it in two and placed a blanket on top to make it a little more comfortable because it is kind of scratchy.  Now at four months it is at is full length and I still put a blanket on top of it.  Whenever he gets it wet I just take the blanket and the cover and wash it easily.  I don\'t have to mess with the fitted sheet and trying to get it off of the mattress which is so hard since they are so tightly fitted against the crib.  This makes life simple and cleaner.  You can use it anywhere.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I really like this sheet!  It keeps the rest of my son\'s crib sheets dry, so easy to take off and clean. I have two so I just wash one and use the other.  Especially great for those nighttime leaks when you just need to change baby and the sheet and get back to bed!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I thoroughly enjoy this product. It covers the full top surface of the crib, give or take an inch. My daughter has used 3 of these over the last 3 months. The upper material is soft and smooth with adequate middle absorption so that it catches excess moisture. I used one on her crib on top of a decorative sheet, another doubled over in her playpen under a practical sheet (since the playpen pad can\'t be easily washed), and a third to replace whichever one she soiled most recently. I have not yet had any problems with her getting underneath it. The snaps work well on small crib rails. They may not fit around larger crib posts. I highly recommend this to any new mother with an appropriate crib. At 3am, I love not having to wrestle with the crib mattress.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",I recently attended a baby shower and gave this as a gift.  The mother had requested a couple of these.  Since then she has given birth and this sheet has been working well for her.  Great idea for a baby shower gift.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I absolutely love this sheet! Changing my babies sheet is effortless, thanks to this great invention. Just snap one off and snap another one on- so convenient, especially for those middle of the night changes! A couple of my snaps have fallen off over time, but it\'s no big deal, and the sheet will still work- I highly recommed this sheet to anyone who has a baby!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",We got these sheets because they got good reviews but I hated them. They don\'t wash up well. They bunch all up and fall apart after several washes. The elastic that straps to the slats doesn\'t hold up well to washing either. They look absolutely awful on the bed because they don\'t cover the whole mattress. I am tossing them in the garbage!!,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I\'ve had no problems with the product. No shrinkage, no getting under the sheet, no bunching, etc. I LOVE the UCS and have bought it for MANY of my friends.You gotta have at least 2 though.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I love this crib sheet because of its ease of removal and replacement and its protection against all leaks and blowouts.  A friend had recommended it and Im so glad she did.  From the side you cannot even see it is there because it sits on top of the sheet (it is nice to have the matching sheet for the set to look nice).  When a leak happens, just unsnap, throw in the wash, and replace when dried (or buy two which makes it easier).  That way you are not fighting trying to cover the mattress with a sheet each time, lifting and tucking, etc.  This does make life much easier.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I bought two of these thinking, &quot;What a wonderful timesaver&quot;.  But after they were washed a few times, I started noticing that they had started leaking through and moisture was getting on the crib sheet, which meant I ended up changing the crib sheet anyhow. So I am pretty disappointed in the product; my baby is only 3 months old so these really haven\'t been used that long.  I followed the washing/drying directions but apparently unless these things are handwashed and line dried (and who has time for that w/ a young baby), the lower layer of vinyl doesn\'t hold up.Also, on one of them, the snaps that hold the sheet to the crib have never worked right and never stay.  I wished I hadn\'t wasted the money on these.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","The concept of this product is good, but I found the snaps extremely difficult to snap and unsnap (maybe they get easier with a little wear, but I haven\'t used it enough to see).  Therefore, I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets (which are also more attractive).  I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out.  Seems like most crib mattresses slide out pretty easily, making this product pretty unnecessary.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I saw the postings on the dangers of this product, but I just love it! We do have one on our crib, but we really only use the crib for playtime. We also keep one on the pack n play\'s bassinet feature and our cosleeper. They\'re easy maintenance and comfy! If you provide lots of supervision for your child, I really don\'t see any danger. I will continue to enjoy their benefits!",5

I wish they would have worked!",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I thought this looked wonderful in the store so I registered for a couple.  Afterwards I attempted to put a cute sheet and mattress pad in the crib... such a chore!  I started using these and haven\'t had to change the cute sheet since.  It\'s so easy to just snap on and not fuss with anything else.  It\'s a soft sheet on top, an absorbent layer in the middle, and a waterproof vinyl back so nothing leaks through.  I\'ve changed it in the middle of the night in a couple minutes tops... it washes up great with my baby\'s normal laundry too!  I highly recommend these sheets.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have been using these for my son for ten months. It was a huge pain to change his crib sheet as it fits so tightly on the mattress.  With these, I just unsnap the 8 straps connecting the crib sheet to the crib.  I can take the dirty one off and put a clean one on in two minutes or less.  I have two of these, and I am so grateful that I have them!When washing, be sure to take the two removeable straps (one at the top and one at the bottom) off the sheet, and snap closed the six straps that are sewn to the sheet.  That way the straps will not tear in the wash.  I wash them normally in the washer and dry them in the dryer.  I have had no trouble whatsoever with these sheets.  I plan to buy these for everyone I know for their baby shower gifts.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I love this product!  It\'s such a pain to change the crib sheet and take off the bumper pads, but with this product you just change this and you\'re done.  It attaches with snaps so you don\'t have to worry about SIDS.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We have used Ultimate Crib sheets since the beginning with our 9 month old twins.  They were a huge time saver and we have recommended them to other parents.  This morning I found one of our girls ""pinned"" under a corner of the sheet nearly suffocating.  She had managed to get her head under the corner and the tension on the snap trapped her head under the sheet facing the rubber bottom.  She is ok, but needless to say we have removed our Ultimate Crib sheets and will not be using them any longer.  Please be careful and don\'t let this happen to you!!!",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We have used several of these with our children in the crib. They are nice because one only has to change the top layer rather than trying to re-make the entire crib in the wee hours of the night after a diaper has &#34;lost containment.&#34; We keep several of them on the crib at once so we can unsnap the one, throw it in the hamper, and go back to bed.Unfortunately, there are some durability issues. The waterproof lining on the underside will not last forever. We always wash it in the machine on the gentle cycle and then hang them to dry (we are afraid of the heat of the dryer destroying the waterproof lining). We still have the compromised sheets as the &#34;emergency layer,&#34; but don\'t trust they would hold a leak for very long. The plastic snaps on the tie-downs also break off with time, leaving fewer points to hold the sheet down.Even with the durability issues, this is the best product we have found for protecting both the crib mattress and some semblance of sleep for the parents when there is a mess.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I agree with the other mom\'s this item is so wonderful and very easy to use..But I have to also agree that they are somewhat disposable,when you wash them the snaps fall off.....This is a lot cheaper than what I paid for them, I bought mine at babies r us and spent 20 a piece on them....",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We originally gave this a negative review but I can positively review it for the specific purpose of using it as a urine-resistant layer UNDER a top sheet.  We have the Clouds and Stars zip-up sheets (which I have loved for years) and use the Ultimate Crib Sheet under the zip-up sheet, so when our child would have an accident we would unzip the zip-up sheet and pull off the top and Ultimate sheets and wash both.  It\'s protected our mattresses over the years.  I wouldn\'t use it as a top sheet since it seemed that the sheet could easily be bunched up or pulled off by a strong baby, and I\'d be concerned about suffocation hazards if a baby wiggles their way underneath, or a choking hazard (if a baby pulls off one of the two end pieces, which go around the crib bars at either end of the crib, and which could fully snap off).  But for this limited use, we used it happily for years.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have loved having these crib sheets!  I only have to use one regular sheet, and then this goes over the top.  When it needs to be changed, a few snaps does the trick and off it comes.  Otherwise I\'d have to have a mattress pad, a waterproof pad, and a regular sheet, and all three would have to come off for each change.  With the thick mattress on the crib, changing them would be a real chore.  The Ultimate Crib Sheet saves time and money.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This is truly an ""all-in-one"" crib sheet! It\'s absorbent, soft, and fairly easy to get on and off. It also covers the entire crib - much better than those itsy-bitsy ""leak guards"" we got that only cover about one square foot!The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that not all the snaps stayed snapped. The elastic-snap thingies (that allow you to secure it to the crib) started to wear out before the crib sheet - one was always coming unsnapped - so I ended up just leaving one unsnapped.All in all, however, this is a great buy. I recommend getting 2 so you always have one handy.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",The reviews that say this product is soft are all pretty old (2002-2004 isn). Recent reviews all agree that the product is not soft. Somewhere down the line they must have tried to save some money and made this product. I wouldn\'t sleep on this so will not use it for my son\'s crib. As far as protecting the sheet it probably does what is says...but I\'ll never know since I\'m returning it.,2
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This product is great in that you do not have to tear apart allbedding/mattress to change the sheet. Makes life easier when you already have too much to do.  The back of the sheets have cracked and started peeling after about 1- 1 1/2 yr of use.My biggest concern, however, is my son was able to pull off the snaps that secure the mattress to the crib. He started this at around 1 1/2yrs. This appears to me to be a huge choking hazard!!",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I absolutely love the idea of this crib sheet. After receiving one as a gift I immediately tried putting it in the crib. To my disappointment, the elastics at the corners will not fit around the wide posts of my crib. For those of you that have Italian made cribs (I have a Baby Italia), this sheet may not work for you either. This should come as no suprise since it is also harder to find crib bumpers that fit correctly too. Needless to say, if you have an Italian made crib, keep the packaging and the receipt. You may find that you\'ll have to try another brand.",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",This crib sheet is a must have.  There\'s no constant changing of the regular crib sheets which are a pain change.  Just pop this one off and throw it in the washing machine.  It\'s also portable.  You can put it underneath your baby no matter where he is sleeping.  Pregnant?  Worried that your water will break in bed and soak your sheets and mattress?  Just lay the crib sheet on top of or under your fitted sheet and your worries are over.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This product was exactly what I needed. I could not find one locally & my only choice was to drive to another, larger town.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I absolutely love this.If you want something easy, ( what mom doesn\'t?! ) I suggest getting these.They are waterproof, and so easy to change- I honestly don\'t know what I would do without them!Just make sure to register for at least 3-- one for in the wash, on for in the crib, and one for when the baby decides to ""dribble "" in the crib!ENJOY!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I, unfortunately, bought a non-standardized crib (I didn\'t know it at the time). I couldn\'t find sheets in the store and could only order them from the manufacturer of the crib (at a decent price). I found these and they\'re great because I can snap them into place and although the top and bottom of the mattress is exposed, it\'s no different than if I had shrunk it in the dryer.Speaking of shrinking, they do shrink A LOT, even on low heat. However, the efficience of just having to change this sheet by unsnapping it and putting the spare on saves an unimaginable amount of time and energy. You should at least try one once.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We bought two of these shortly before our son was born, and I could not be happier.  I purchase them on Amazon because they were cheaper than where we registered (I think they were on sale at the time).  He is now 11 months old and we have been using these ever since he was transitioned to his crib at around 3-4 months old.  They are incredible time savers!  They snap on easily and quickly, they are really easy to take off (just pull it off), wash up wonderfully in the washing machine, can go in dryer no problem, and are actually very soft fabric.  They are waterproof but don\'t feel rubbery or like plastic on the side the baby sleeps on.  Our son loves them so much, he actually won\'t sleep in his crib until we have one on.  He has peed, pooped, and vomited on these things and they still look and feel great after over 7 months of use.  We have never had the problem of him getting stuck underneath it.  It stretches tight enough to the slats on his crib that he can\'t get it off the mattress.  The best part is the same as everyone else said, you don\'t have to change the cute sheets underneath it, so you don\'t have to worry about taking off the bumpers, lifting the mattress, etc. for those middle of the night messes.  Just snap off, snap on!  Also, having the Ultimate Crib Sheet be a plain solid color is a really good idea.  My son gets too distracted by the little figures on his regular sheets and spends time trying to pick them off his sheets instead of going to sleep.As everyone else has said, if you are going to get this product, I would definitely buy two so you have an extra that can go on the bed while the other is in the laundry.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I really do like the idea of this crib sheet. The only problem is that I have a very thick convertible crib (crib, toddler, full bed) and the corners are too big for the staps to secure to the snap. For now the sheet is secured to the slat beside the corner leaving about an inch of space not covered by the sheet...no biggy, worth it for the convenience. I plan to eventually replace the elastic closures with longer elastic pieces for a perfect fit.",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",Yes i have pretty sheets on the crib......but who wants to wash them every time there is a mess.  Well this is the answer!  So much easier (since they snap around the crib slats) to get on and off!  Waterproof!!  What else should i say!  Perfect gift!!!,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I measured the crib before purchasing this, but it was not a hood fit for our standard Jenny Lind crib. Some of the elastic snaps could not stretch far enough to snap closed, so they just hung thee. It did not make me feel comfortable to have those straps dangling since they could have been a potential choking hazard.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","When I bought these two years ago for my daughter, they were the best sheets!  Thickly padded and washed and dried like a dream.  I still have them and use then regularly.  THEN, when my son came along this year, I got two more.  WHAT JUNK!  They are now less than half as thick and after only one washing the vinyl backing is all wrinkled.  DON\'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, they won\'t last a month of washing.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Can\'t imagine life without this!  It\'s my favorite thing besides his favorite blankie.  I got two Ultimate Crib Sheets when my son was born.  He\'s now 18 mths and they are still going strong, although they have started showing some wear underneath.  Mine are a bit short on the ends, but it doesn\'t bother me or him.  I recently changed the sheet on his bed, but don\'t think I\'ve done so for about six months.  It doesn\'t really get dirty unless you have some serious overnight leaking, which we recently have had (obviously time to size up his diapers).  Changing the sheet means taking the bumper most of the way off and the mattress out of the crib.  I certainly don\'t have time for that on a weekly basis and you won\'t either.  Make sure and get a couple!!!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have 4 daughters and was greatful for this crib sheet.  I had purchased 1 over the telephone several years ago from an ad.  After I received it, I called and purchased 3 more.  My kids are a little older now and no longer in baby beds, but I still use them when they are sick by placing them under their pillows.  It still saves me from changing sheets all of the time.  I have purchased a sheet for everyone I know having a baby for the past 5 years and they all end up buying more of them. THIS IS THE BEST IDEA FOR A CRIB SHEET THAT WAS EVER INVENTED!!!!!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",Received this sheet and after I felt the scratchy material I started reading all the reviews on this and realized I made a good decision by sending it back! It sounds like this thing is a death trap! Many moms find their babies underneath the pad suffocating! So glad I sent it back before having to learn the hard way.,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","My son spit up in his sleep for the first 6 months, so this product was wonderful.  However, by the time that he was 6 months old, all of my ultimate crib sheets had developed holes and cracks in the plastic backs.  The product was such a life saver that I will purchase new ones (maybe a different brand) for future children, but I really expected more than 6 months of use out of these.",2
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",The Ultimate Crib Sheet is the ultimate gift for both baby and mom. No more wrestling with a fitted crib sheet. Just lay the Ultimate Crib Sheet over the pretty fitted sheet that matches the bedding and snap it in place. In less than a minute a new sheet is in place and the crib didn\'t have to be moved and mom didn\'t get frustrated trying to keep the sheet around the matress while the bumper pads kept pushing it off. It\'s perfect for those middle-of-the-night sheet changes and it can even be put on one-handed. A must for all moms!,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Our newborn baby boy has been having a ball spraying us every time we change him. Thank goodness we bought these crib sheets! I can\'t see the sheets underneath really well, since it covers the entire top of it, but it keeps it clean and dry. The top is soft, while the bottom is lined with plastic.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This sheet is such a smart purchase.  Yes, it may be fun to get all of the adorable printed sheets, but this is so much better.  When you have to change sheets in the middle of the night, it is SO much better to simply unsnap and snap this sheet rather than lifting up the cumbersome mattress to get a regular sheet on it.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",I received 2 of these sheets as a gift after my daughter was born.  I already had several sheets and didn\'t think I would use these...then I tried them.  I can\'t say enough great things about this product.  It is so easy to change the bedding now.  No more lifting up that huge mattress.  Make sure and have 2 of them-so that you can have one clean at all times.  It takes me less than 3 minutes to change the sheets.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",This item posses a chocking hazzard. I woke up to my 6 month old gagging on the elastic strap that holds the sheet to the crib. While it may seem like a wonderful invention (oh how i miss it!) I don\'t think it\'s worth the risk.,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",Seems to fit just fine except that the corner snaps could be longer.  We have a Sorelle Rosa crib with hidden hardware so the snaps must go around the outside of two bars for each corner.  The straps are just not long enough to effectively go around all 4 corners.  No big deal though as we just do two corners and then go around the first set of bars on the far side.  So the sheet is offset by a couple inches but doesn\'t appear to have enough slack to become a safety issue.  If our baby does start to try to get under the sheet it doesn\'t seem like a difficult task to just add our our strap extensions.  We\'ll probably be buying a few more to allow for more time between laundry runs.,4
Basic Comfort Handy\'s Plus Pad Full,"I purchased 2 of these for use on my son\'s twin size mattress.  They are wonderful!  They contain everything, wash up beautifully and have drastically decreased the amount of laundry that I have to do.  The full size pads are actually the perfect size for a twin mattress in my opinion.  I was worried that the twin size pads would be too small, and I\'m glad I went with the full size.Update 01/31/2009:  We\'ve owned these pads for a little over a year now, and they\'ve been great!  With washing 2-4 times per week, both pads are now starting to leak through to the mattress below because the waterproof shielding is starting to develop little cracks and pinholes here and there, so it\'s now time to replace them.",5
Basic Comfort Handy\'s Plus Pad Full,I was looking for a nightime waterproof pad for an elderly person.  After looking through what Amazon offered I choose this one and have been pleased with it.  It does a terrific job in absorbing and keeping the bed dry.  It is also very soft and comfortable.Its not as large as the picture would indicate.  Take the measurements given seriously.This is an excellent value.  Recommended.,5
Basic Comfort Handy\'s Plus Pad Full,"I bought a full size pad for my son\'s twin bed, and we are able to use it in other sizes of beds too.  It is not too bulky and it is nice for traveling.  Since my son has not had any accident yet, I don\'t know how well it absorbs.",3
Basic Comfort Handy\'s Plus Pad Full,"While my 4 yr old had been potty trained since she was about 2-1/2, she wasn\'t making it thru the night & so we used Pull Up every night. Shortly after she turned 4 she started waking up with dry pull ups.  We gave it a few weeks to make sure it wasn\'t a fluke & then invested in *two* of these pads.  The tuck in feature on both sides is great & I find that it does stay in place even after a nights sleep.  She finds it comfortable as she\'s never complained about it (of course, Princess sheets accomanied this new pad to encourage acceptance and we made a HUGE deal about her giving up Pull Ups & sleeping in regular underwear).  The best part about this design is that if there is an accident, you just whip it off (and any other top sheet that might have gotten wet) and tuck in a dry one.  No changing the fitted sheet in the middle of the night.  For us, if the top sheet or blanket gets wet, I\'ve got a second comforter/blanket in her closet to quickly throw over her. (of course pajama changing can\'t be avoided) That helps get everyone back to sleep as fast as possible.  I\'ve washed them a number of times & they come out of the dryer in the same shape every time (follow washing instructions). The size is also generous.  I was worried that she might move off the pad during the night, but with proper placement to where she normally sleeps most of the night, we\'ve never had a problem.  It says it absorbs 6 cups; while we haven\'t tested that, I\'ve never found the pad dripping, so all the urine was securely soaked in.  We haven\'t found a down side to these pads.  Even the price isn\'t bad-- I did some price comparison and maybe you\'ll find them a few bucks less, but not by much.  And, if I may add in a bit of my own potty training 2-cents, my husband wanted her to give up pull ups much earlier, but I was in no mood to change sheets (or these pads) *every* night.  I\'ve read that most toddlers\' bladders aren\'t large enough to make it thru the night anyway, so I was just as happy to let it happen naturally. In that way, everyone was happy (well I was and you know what they say about Mamma being happy-- everyone\'s happy!)  Thus, I highly recommend this pad to anyone going down the no-more-Pull-Ups Road.  I am sure it would be just as useful for any older child (and parents) dealing with bed-wetting problem.",5
Basic Comfort Handy\'s Plus Pad Full,I got this for my three-year-old daughter to use at night since she still has night time accidents.  It works fabulous!  Super absorbant.  Makes my life so much easier!  I bought two in the beginning and now I\'m buying two more.,5
"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;",Great Product ... Highly Recommend! No more changing crib and toddler bed sheets in the middle of the night!,5

"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;","It does the job of protecting the mattress, the flaps for tucking under the bed come out a lot though. Not sure if it\'s worth the hassle of having them.  My daughter tends to be a wiggle worm though.  I suppose without them the pad might not be remotely in the right spot in the morning though. We bought two for a twin bed since she is all over the bed during the course of an evening and I wanted to make sure we were covered. 1 would work for a toddler/crib sized mattress, if you have a twin you will probably want 2.",4

This pad is a great item, it\'s soft on the top so my son doesnt mind sleeping on it and it really works keeping the sheets dry. My son sleeps all over the place and it\'s plenty wide enough to give the coverage we need. And it\'s never leaked through. The only reason I didn\'t give it 5 stars was that it\'s tough to tuck the far side in when you have the bed up against the wall like we do. I\'m not sure how they could make this better, but they should work on figuring out a way. ;) I only wish I\'d gotten 2!!",4
"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;",This is my second one and it works like a charm. Just don\'t put it in the dryer on high setting or the backing will start to come apart and the waterproofness is no longer.,5

He is adorable and fun to have around during the day and besides house training him, he\'s pretty easy to take care of. I could get him to a puppy pad or outside during the day but at night he would go without waking me up and then go back to sleep since he was so young. I got very tired of cleaning pee off my mattress and constantly washing my blankets but I didn\'t want to spend a ton of money on a full cover since I sleep on a full size mattress. This small cover was a good price and big enough to cover the area where he always goes. I do wish it was bigger but it works very well. I would definitely recommended it.",4

"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;",I bought two pads for my toddler and have been using them for a year. They work fine and save her mattress from many bed wets. However the surface area of the pad is not very big and my toddler likes to turn and flip around when sleeping. Hence we put two pads on the bed and that solves the problem. My only complaint is the folding area could be longer. My toddler\'s mattress was very thick and the pads would shift position as the cloth that is folded underneath the mattress is very little.,4

Basic Comfort EZ Changing Pad,"I put this on my baby registry for my first born. After having her home from the hospital for a month, I became very unhappy with this changing pad. My baby had very loose stools (from a strictly breast milk diet) and she soiled this pad close to every changing. I kept having to wash the cover. My girl friend recommended to me another changing pad on the babiesrus website called the ""Contoured Changing Pad"" that has a permanent plastic cover on it (that allows for a wipe clean surface).  I got one and found it to be worlds better than the E-Z pad. In fact I now have two of them, one for upstairs and one for down.",1
Basic Comfort EZ Changing Pad,"I got this pad as a baby shower gift and I think it is just fine. I\'ve never used the velcro straps to strap down my baby, I think you can do without those. I had a changing table given to me and this just fit right in it perfectly. I also got terry cloth changing pad covers with this gift and they fit nicely. Then I put one of those waterproof flannel pads down underneath the terry cloth cover and a smaller one on top of the cover where the baby\'s bottom goes. I wash the terry cloth cover once a week and don\'t need to do much more because if he pees or poops in the middle of a change I\'ve got the waterproof pad on top as a back up and just change that out.As a newborn though, when I would put him on the changing table, his legs and arms would flail out and he felt like he was falling and he\'d scream. At my mom\'s house she has a different changing table that has more of a dip to it where he lays and he never did that there-guess he feels more secure that way and can feel the sides of the pad and table hugging him. That would be the only downfall is that it needs to have more of a dip to it. Other than that, it\'s a great pad-nice and comfy and I like the cover that comes with it, but I\'ve always got other layers on top so I never really see it.",5

Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I bought this diaper pail because the store had run out of the Fisher Price pail I had originally intended to buy. Boy was I sorry!! Aside from the fact that the diaper pail fell apart into many little pieces every time I went to change the bag, It did not contain the quite pungent odor that accompanies dirty diapers.While this diaper pail was cheaper than the Diaper Genie, I found it to be a complete waste of my hard earned money, as it doesn\'t even serve well as a basic trash can.",1
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,this bin is great for cloth diapers. we love ours. keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two\'s worth of diapers-- which is all i need because we wash every other day. Our local Babies R Us sells replacement deodisks (or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors) when the one that comes with it loses it\'s smell so that you can maintain freshness. It\'s easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive.,5
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"We bought this pail for our first son.  It was easy to use and easy to load new bags.  It was also great that it just used regular kitchen trash bags.  However, it did not contain the smell of diapers hardly at all.  You could walk into his room and smell the diaper pail.  Would recommend trying a different type.",2
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I liked the idea of this pail using regular kitchen trash bags, however, it is a pain to change the bag.  Also, it is not odor-less.",1
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I was using the diaper genie and I wasn\'t at all impressed. I was at a shop needing to pick up Genie refills and saw this pail on sale for $14. I bought it. From day one I loved it I threw out the genie and I won\'t go back.It only got 4 stars because you do need to buy fresh disks every so often. They are nice because when you open the pail you smell a fresh clean sent. Also I feel the pail could be taller, when I change the kitchen bag (which is the only time you really smell the foul diapers) my bag was only about 3/4 the way full.But other than that its a great investment, no smelly nursery and no dang refills to buy!",4
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills.  Well, it did not control odor.  The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week.  The odor escaped even when the pail was closed.  You do save money on refills at first.  But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often.  I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink.Also, the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily, and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things.I would not recommend this product.",2
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,I babysit 8-12 kids usually a day and 2-4 of them are in diapers and this product is real easy because i can keep it anywhere without it stinking everything up and it is easy to dispose of the bags. It is just like a garbage can you would keep in the kitchen or in a bathroom but it really keeps away the odor and it is great cause it is quick and easy jus tbny hitting the button and closing it. Very simply to do while holding a 4 mth old and a 22 mth old,5

Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,Thanks to this wonderful diaper pail I never have to smell dirty diapers! The other wonderful part is you can use regular trash bags( I buy the drawstring so I never catch a whiff of the contents) instead of pricey refills!! I highly recommend this product!,5
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"It\'s not worth it!  I have tried Diaper Genie and Safety 1st, now I\'ll have to try something new.  This diaper pail has broken on me and I\'ve had to have parts replaced.  I had to pay the mailing cost to send the broken part in!!  It was cheap, but not worth the loss of time trying it. It stinks--even with only one smelly diaper in it.",1
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I\'ve found that the Odor-Less Diaper Pail is nowhere near odorless!!  It was okay when our baby was still making the non-smelly diapers, but FORGET IT once your kid is on solids.  My husband empties that pail every few days (then sprays the inside with Lysol) when it\'s only filled with pee pee diapers.  And it is ready to be emptied by then, because it reeks of urine.  Don\'t even think about keeping poopy diapers in there!!  We have to dump poop, from a soiled diaper, in the toilet and just throw away the diaper because the Odor-Less Diaper Pail DOES NOT contain the smell.  Buyer BEWARE!

Also the first time I changed the bag, the springs broke under the top.  I still use it because it\'s the only thing I have, but I would not reccommend this to anyone.

It\'s not exactly odor proof, but you won\'t smell anything unless you leave it for more than two weeks. I keep a spray can of room freshener next to the pail and when I get a stinking diaper, I give the pail lid (the inside blue part) a quick spray and everything is fine.

You will end up spending more money to replace it with a better one.",1
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I purchased this diaper pail for my son and let me tell you it was more work keeping up this pail then it was caring for a newborn.  We purchased this product because there were no special bags to buy and it had an area to place deoderizer tablets.  Well the spring popped off every time we put a diaper in it which left a space for the smell to come out. It was nasty.  We had to constantly fix the springs just so it was close up each time.  The pail stunk so bad even with the tablets and an air freshener in the bottom of the bucket.  It was so bad, we soaked it and washed it and it still stunk. We ended up throwing it in the dumpster. It was just horrible. Not a good product and poorly made.",2
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,Not being able to find the deodorizer discs refills was my only complaint. I found them. You can order them directly from Safety 1st by calling 1-800-544-1108. They are 50 cents each plus shipping and handling.,4
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"We have this diaper pail, and it seems to work fine for us.  Our son is one year old now, and the pail is working fine.  The springs have never popped off and odors are very low.  Yes, the capacity fills up rather quickly, but that really isn\'t a problem. It is easy to use and can be filled with household bags.  I registered for another one for baby #2.",4
Cord \'Shortner,"I love these cord shorteners. I have 11 month old twins and have bought several of these to put in the areas they play in. I have also used them in my own bedroom, even though the twins are never in there. One of these wraps my electric toothbrush cord up nice and neat so it isn\'t taking up all of the sink. It wraps up two thin cords together or 1 thick cord by itself.This product has made having twins a lot easier. It is durable and comes with sticky stuff to adhere it to the wall, although removal of it will mean patching up and repainting. I never stick it to the wall, but it does a great job and hiding all the cords we have around the house. The kids are no longer interested in the plugs when these things are in place. And if I decide I need to move and item, it easily comes apart with a push of the center.",5
Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"What a pain! My daughter could open them no problem, luckily because it was so easy she wasn\'t interested in it. You have to take them off to use the broiler. Like another reviewer said, it\'s easier just to remove your knobs...don\'t waste your money.",1

Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"These knobs are fairly easy to remove.  They provide basic protection, but it a toddler is determined he/she can get these off.

Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"I bought this because everytime I go to my cabinet above the stove, I accidently turn on the stove knobs.  These work!",5
Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,My daughter can no longer get to the stove knobs. Everyone is happy about that! They do exactly what they say they do. Good value.,5
Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"First off, these may not fit everyone\'s range. They are designed to fit a wide variety of standard-sized knobs, but may not work for you. Yes, you must remove your knobs to get these covers on initially, but if they fit, they definitely work. Yes, you must open the cover to turn your knob, but remember, these are safety devices, not convenience devices.That said, they worked on my GE Profile range, thankfully. From what I could tell, most of the GE ranges use the same knob types, so if you\'ve got a GE, I believe these covers will fit.I had kept these (and a few other knob covers) on my wish list until my daughter learned how to reach up and turn on the gas. I had been reluctant to order because of all the snarky reviews - there didn\'t seem to be a highly-rated knob cover. Well, suddenly, I needed something right away! I immediately ordered these ones, which arrived very quickly (thank you Amazon Prime!), and I had them installed in about two minutes. Neither my wife nor I have any difficulty opening or closing these with one hand, and my toddler can no longer turn on the gas.On a negative, my knobs are located directly above the oven door opening, so I must agree with other reviews here that I run the risk of 1) snapping off the caps when I close the oven door, and 2) melting the covers if I leave the oven door open. I do not blame Safety First for this, if you want to consider this a design flaw - I would blame GE for that one! Knowing this has allowed me to preserve them from breaking (thanks to other reviews). I do wish that this was a 6 pack, though, since I have 6 knobs on the range - the main reason this is only a 4 star rating. I have a bottom warming drawer, which is electric and harder to turn on, so I opted to leave that knob exposed, preferring to protect the gas knobs, instead.On the positive, It works. My toddler was constantly turning on the gas, or changing the flame height on the stove while my wife or I were cooking - you know how they love to imitate. We would also occasionally smell gas, and we knew she had tried to do some cooking again. Those brief moments of the unattended wandering child are the biggest reason for these knob covers - scary to think of a gas explosion! :-( After installing these, she still reaches up to the knobs, but now she merely spins these covers, leaving the knobs untouched. And now that we no longer need to chide or punish her for turning knobs (really for just being curious), she has lost a great deal of interest in them altogether. These will stay on the range, however, until they break or are no longer needed.If they break, I will definitely replace with the same ones.",4
Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"We thought that these were the same Safety 1st knob covers that we had purchased two years ago. Those were larger, and were very easy to open with one hand, using minimal force. These are much smaller, barely cover our knobs, and are nearly impossible to open with one hand. One of us CANNOT open them without pulling the knob off of the stove, the other needs to stop cooking and concentrate on the proper amount of force to apply in order to open them.Overall, these knob covers are very good at covering knobs, and preventing little fingers from turning them, but they are not very good at letting you use the knob in a manner that will permit cooking.Take a little more time and look for the larger, easier to open Safety 1st knob covers (with a thumb-sized push-pad).",1
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,"The product itself works great, it\'s just a little hard to use. It\'s a little difficult to get the sides squeezed to get it open, and if your cord is larger than the standard size it\'s a little tight. But it keeps the little people out.",4
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,My little guy is very active and loves to get into trouble. We only have a couple items plugged into an outlet that isn\'t covered by furniture so I purchased these to make sure he couldn\'t pull the plug out of the wall and get shocked. They are wonderful and I feel much safer letting my little guy explore the house. Even though I am never too far away our let him out of sight he still manages to get into things. He is so fast and just a little distraction could be fatal. But I don\'t have to worry about the plugs anymore! One less worry and just the little bit of stress relief that makes this purchase very easy for me to recommend it to all parents.,5
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,These are great- easy to install and actually keep prying little fingers out of the sockets!,5
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,"My 1 yr old is very clever, but he can not work out how to open these, they have been a life saver - literally!!!!",4
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,"Would work great for things like lamps, clocks, etc that have thin cables.  But power bar cables are too thick to fit in these.  Bummer.",1
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,"I had to use a chisel to scrape the plastic so that it would fit our standard outlet.If you are willing to chisel some of the plastic, then it will fit.The cable guide at the bottom cannot handle shielded cable from a power strip (some shaving of plastic will solve this also.)The entire box may not cover the outlet completely and leave a gap around the edges where kids can insert things and reach the wires.",3
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,"These outlet covers do just what they are supposed to. I\'m not at all concerned about my little ones being able to bust into them...they are hard enough for adults to disconnect! I wasn\'t sure about the quality of a Safety 1st product (seems to be hit or miss with this company), but I was pleasantly surprised by the integrity of these covers. And the price is great for a 2-pack.",5
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,"I can\'t believe I\'m even saying this, but the plug cover portion of these covers - that is, the part that screws into the wall socket - doesn\'t fit.  I have regular plug sockets throughout the house, old style with the screw in the middle, and these things won\'t fit on any plug socket.  The holes are too narrow.....After some frustration and some thought, I realized that these outlet covers are designed to fit over the existing plug cover, not to replace it as most others do.  They are, in fact, not even big enough to enclose the hole in the wall, and once I realized that it all fell into place.In any case, that\'s the story.  Maybe it\'ll save someone else the aggravation.Are they any good?  Well, they do what they\'re supposed to do.  As others have said, very hard to remove, so only use them on sockets that will not have plugs frequently changed.",3
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,"These are fine for standard, thin power cords.  We have had one in place that the kids have never dislodged despite two years of trying.  But they will not close over the heavy, thick cords like those for microwaves, computers, or power bars.  We finally ended up attaching ours to the wall with duct tape to cover those cords.I am giving this three stars because it does work fairly well for thin cords, and because I have yet to see anything better out there.  My advice?  Invest in duct tape.",3
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,A clean and easy install. Very secure. Impossible for children (and hard for adults) to get to your plugs.Will not work with oversized plugs or adapters.,5
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,These things are awful! I can\'t even get them apart to install them. I even had my husband try and he couldn\'t get them apart either. I know it\'s suppose to be baby proof but come on??,1
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,"This would be 5 stars, but the cover is hard to open once the unit is installed. This doesn matter much to me as the two things that are plugged into my outlet are not things I move around...so they are staying in there! Overall, I thought this was easy to install and I feel much better knowing my little monkey can\'t unplug things and get hurt.",4
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,Almost impossible to open for installation and to use once installed. Good because Im 99.9% sure my little one will never get hurt but my hands hurt now. A few swear words needed to remain mentally sound during install process lol,4
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,I bought this thinking it was a great idea but you can\'t use it with any plugs that have a larger than standard plugs. I feel everything of my children\'s has an oversize plug that goes in the wall. Have yet found anything to use it for.,2
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,This thing works but it\'s very tricky getting off. If you work it a little you figure out how it will just pop off. Don\'t get discouraged like I did. Work it gently and It will come off easy with a little presure. Does not fit a bulky box plug in head only standard ones like a lamp.,5
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,"Great to keep kids away from plugs, but it prevents me from using the plugs as well. If you have something that is plugged in permanently, it may work great but don\'t use this for an outlet you need to access regularly.",3
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,"These were a complete hassle to pry apart just to install them.  My mom and I each held a side and pulled, but nothing.  I finally had to shove in the latches as far as I could to get them apart.  Since that seems to be the only way to take the cover off, I had to leave the latches pushed in, defeating the purpose of keeping kids from pulling them off.  Definitley something I would use as a permanent fixture.  It\'s too much of a hassle to take it off every time you need to plug something in.  I plugged in what I needed to and have not intention of switching them up.",2
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,"There is no way a toddler or even some adults could get to the plugs under this thing, it is very secure. However, I decided to stop using this as an over cautious mother, thinking if a child gets caught up in the cord it should be able to come free of the wall to prevent strangulation.",3
Plug \'N Outlet Cover,This thing is so hard to get off that neither you nor your children will ever get to your outlets again.  This is not a product you should buy if you want to use your outlets once in a while.  It took me 15 minutes to pry it open.,3
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"First, this product is HUGE. Second, your kids can easily put their fingers right in and flip that button.  I can even put my fingers in and they are much bigger than my 19 month old! This is not a child proofing object. It\'s more of a big chunk of plastic that serves no purpose whatsoever.  I would NOT buy this product.",1
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"We have two power strip covers at our house--one by safety 1st and the other by Mommy\'s Helper.  The Safety 1st cover far exceeds the quality and durability of the Mommy\'s Helper cover (whose buckles looked like they might break if opened too often.)  I like the Safety 1st cover because it allows for adjustability in length and is very wide inside, as well as looking quite sturdy.  There was plenty of width inside ours as well, so I\'m no sure what other reviews were referring to.  For extra safety, we covered the unused sockets on the strip with plugs...wish I had purchased this one first!",5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"I bought one of these to see if it would fit over an extra-long power strip. The product description wasn\'t entirely clear, and it turns out that the description is at the small side. Sliding the case, it can cover larger power strips.It\'s also remarkably child-proof. Our household has an 8-month-old who\'s getting into everything. While she\'s usually blocked from getting to the computer desks, it\'s smart to err on the side of caution and protect every power strip in the house.I\'m very pleased with this product and will order more, now that I see how versatile, sturdy, and safe they are.",4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"The product does work, I just have a very inventive child. The opening up top is just large enough for him to get his fingers in and still cut off the power or pull a cord.",4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"I ordered this some time ago. I finally started using it last week. It was very difficult to figure out how to use. But, once I ready the instructions a few times I got it.  My 8 month old loves all electric cords. I needed something to protect her. For the past week this has been working.Only one side of it can I get a big 3 prong plug into it. I only need 2 openings to get in and out of so it hasn\'t presented itself as a major problem yet. I would purchase another one of these.",4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"This is a perfect baby proofing tool.  The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips.  There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it.  It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places.  It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes.  Overall, best power strip cover I\'ve seen.",5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"What a great idea, to protect your power strip.  Wish i had one of these growing up and could have prevented a lot of nights being sent to my room without dinner.",5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"Does the job! It\'s huge. But, it has to be to fit everything in there. I\'m just grateful someone made something like this to keep our kids safe from electrocution. :)",5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,My baby was unable to pull it off or remove any plugs from to power strip and it is a great product.,5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"Doesn\'t fit the strip we have our computer/tv plugs in. Its too small. We intended it to use there, but are using it in our bedroom instead.",3
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"I like this and will probably order another one, but I had to switch out the power strip I wanted to originally use it for because the strip was too long. So, other than that it is great.",4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,Easy to use!,5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"I got this for my son\'s room and it would be fine except that most kid stuff has larger plugs that do not fit inside (for example for the wipes warmer).  If you are plugging in standard sizes only, it should work great.  We ended up not using it.",4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"Seriously, I just got this, and this product is not worth a single penny. It is too bulky and gets in the way. Even when it is on its smallest setting! Not just that, but there is a large opening at the top for the cords to fit through, but the gap is so big, my kids can still unplug the cords and play with them.",1
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,Fits all of my cords (even my Apple cords) perfectly.  Works exactly as advertised.,4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"its a great product especially if you have mobile kids, babies or toddlers. keep in mind its kind of bulky i didnt think of that when ii purchased this but still a good buy for what i needed it for!",3
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"To bulky, not what I expected or needed. Needless to say I gave it to a family member that could use it in a different area. Would not buy again.",2
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"My little one looooves plug ins.  This product prevents her from unplugging my electronic devices, from trying to plug things into the power strip, and from flipping the power strip into the off position.  It keeps my child and my electronics safe!My only critique of this item is that it seems a bit flimsy when fully extended.  The power strip for my entertainment center is a pretty standard length and size and fits in this strip cover with the cover extended fully.  When extended, the cover can wiggle, and if wiggled enough, little hands could possibly figure out how to separate the two pieces, thus gaining access to the power strip.  In an effort to avoid this scenario, I have placed the product placed far enough under my entertainment center that my child would really have to reach to get to it, so the level of concentration that it would take her to both reach for the power strip and open the cover is beyond what she is capable of doing.I am still satsified with this product despite its weakness when fully extended, however, because when I placed the bare power strip in the exact same location, my daughter had no problem both reaching for the power strip and flicking it into the off position.  Furthermore, seeing all those cords, outlets, and plugs motivated her to move the power strip to where she could reach it better and within a matter of moments, she would happily turning it on and off, unplugging things, and trying to ""plug"" foreign objects into it.  So another thing this product succeeds in doing is making the power strip less attractive for her by covering up all the things she likes most about them- buttons, plug ins, and outlets.If this device were more readily accessible (ie: out in the open) I think my daughter would have no problem figuring out how to open it and thus rendering it useless.  It might not have the same problem with a smaller power strip because the product wouldn\'t need to be fully extended.",4
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,"My reason for purchasing a booster chair is because it is a space saver in my small kitchen (as compared to my 16 month old daughter\'s high chair).  I have only used this one for 1.5 weeks so far, but I find it to be quite efficient.  It\'s very basic, but serves its purpose.  My daughter seems to be comfortable with in it.  I either use the tray or push her up to the dinner table next to me.  I have not used it on the go yet so I can\'t speak on that aspect of it.  However, I think it\'s pretty much worth its price.",4
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,"This chair is terrific!  We go out to eat a lot, and my 7 month old is still too small for the restaurant high chairs or booster seats - she pretty much slides right out of them.  The three point harness keeps her in the chair, and the tray keeps her from leaning too far forward, as well as giving her a focal point.  Since she can\'t reach beyond the tray, anything that goes on the tray can go in her mouth.There are also two height adjustments and it folds well for easy carrying.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this a fifth star is how hard it is to put the tray on or take it off.",4
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,"My first son got this booster when he was 2 years old and we mostly used it when we traveled. But when my second son was born a year later, we got tired of having his big high chair in the kitchen. So when he was big enough, we strapped the booster to a chair and that was his place until a few months ago when he decided he wanted to sit in a regular chair (at almost 3).Unlike other reviewers, I have never had any problems with the tray--either keeping it on securely or getting it off easily (I think it is kind of funny that one product can have both of these problems!). The straps have always been adjustable to fit several sizes of kitchen chairs.I will admit it saves food well--to really get out a messy meal we take it outside and shake it upsided down then take the seat out. We did sort of solve the food under the chair issue by putting a dish towel on the seat of the kitchen chair before setting the booster on it. Then all you have to do is take the booster off and fold up the towel to clean the chair underneath!I loved this chair because it meant no highchair to climb over in the kitchen! And if we needed to go visiting we could just throw it in the trunk and have a highchair wherever we needed it.I\'d buy it again in a minute. But someone won\'t have to where I live because I am Freecycling it to someone who can get even more use out of it.By the way, this one outlasted a different brand booster that my parents\' bought for their house that was used half as much and was pretty much broken in two places when they pitched it earlier this year.",5
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,"This booster is a great space saver, but it is very hard to clean. Food falls down the cracks on the sides and in the back. I usually have to unstrap the seat from the chair and clean underneath it. We do like the fact that our daughter can sit up to the table at dinnertime.",3
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,This fold up booster seat is great. I noticed some people complained about the cracks holding food but we just take it apart and put it in the dishwasher like the directions say (only problem is springs in the tray rust). We also occasionally using it on the floor to when our son wants to draw (rub crayongs on paper).,5
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,I bought this seat and returned it.  It didn\'t fit on our dining room chairs very well.  The buckles clip kind of low in the back.  I didn\'t feel this was very secure.  My daughter is a climber.  I was afraid if she leaned over to far that the seat would flip.  We purchased a another one that fits much better.,2
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,"We originally bought this seat because we lived in a small apartment, and only had room for a highchair we could strap onto a kitchen chair.  It is a very durable product.  It is a good space saver, and I like the fact that it comes with a tray, and the tray does fit in the dishwasher :).  However, our tray comes off VERY easily (my daughter merely pushed a little and it popped right off).  Also, on certain chairs, we cannot get the straps that fasten it to a chair to tighten enough, so the seat moves around a lot.  (And the straps are easy to lose if you don\'t keep close track of them.) Like some of the other reviewers, I found it to be a good food storage area! Seriously, food gets caught in all the crevices, and it is not easy to clean unless you take it apart.  I don\'t know if there\'s a better fold-up booster seat/highchair out there, but I would only recommend this seat for going places, and then to use it with close supervision.  We now only use it when we go somewhere or go in the backyard, and I\'ll be darned if I can keep those straps with the seat!! We have to put it on the ground now because we can\'t fasten it to a chair.  We have a real highchair in our house now that we have some room, but I would like to switch to a booster (my son is 2 1/2--it\'s about time).  I don\'t want to bring this one in the house because it\'s so hard to clean up after meals (the booster and the chair underneath--unless you want to scrub the finish off your chairs because you didn\'t know the food was leaking down under the booster!).  On the positive side, the seat has lasted 6 years and is still in great condition.  I just wish the seat were designed better!",3
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,"I was given this booster seat from a friend.  I live in a really tiny house - so tiny that there is no room for a kitchen table! Because of this, at first I didn\'t think I would find much use for a booster seat.  Was I ever wrong.  I use it in the living room so my daughter can (have a dry) snack with me, play with play doh, draw, etc.  I just attach the back of the chair to the coffee table leg so that the chair is stable.  It is also much easier to bring along to functions as compared to a high chair. It also comes in handy when we are one high chair short, such as when we had a Passover dinner at my dad\'s house and my friends brought along their 2 year-old; instead of having them lug their high chair down there, I brought along the booster seat.",4
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,"Only being able to compare this product with an old Fisher Price monitor I can say that this monitor is crystal clear. The old Fisher Price one gave out a constant fussy hum and picked up far to much noise around the room (eg the wind blowing past our windows). I\'m confused though about the packaging between this Graco Ultra Clear Monitor and with the \'Graco Clear Range Monitor\' the only apparent difference being \'microchip technology\' while both are using \'telephone technology\'. However I guess the extra $10 is worth it because this is definately crystal clear, without hissing and without interference. It genuinely only picks up our babies sounds. It is not interfering with our 2.4Ghz cordless phone and I have no idea about the review which says \'it\'s too loud\'. Turn the volume all the way up and only when you put a monitor to your ear can you hear hissing, which is why you only need the volume set down to 2 or 3 (out of 4). It has two channels and so far I\'ve not even had need to try a different channel due to static or interference. Who needs 2.4Ghz monitors (for greater range) like the Sony one- unless you plan on mowing the grass outside while monitoring? And the advantage here is you\'re provided with two monitors not just one.",5
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,"I am currently looking for a monitor for our second child.  We bought this one for our first child 2 years ago.  We thought we were buying quality, but this thing started getting more static at 3 months...then [just like the reader from MA] it stopped working completely.  What a waste of money!!",1
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,Love this monitor!  This monitor is so clear... I can hear my baby move in his crib and the base is across the room from his crib.  From the day we brought him home from the hospital we have used this monitor and it has never failed us!  We recently traveled to another state to visit friends and took the monitor to use while we were there... our friends live in a condo complex with a pool.  This monitor worked from the pool... which was 4 units away from their unit and on the opposite side of the building.  (Don\'t worry... my friend was in the kitchen the whole time because her kids were sleeping in another room.)  My friends were so impressed that they gave away their monitor after we left and bought a GRACO Ultra Clear Monitor to use for their two boys.  So glad we have this one!  Highly recommend!!!,5
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,"I can\'t tell you how clear this monitor is!  I could hear my preemie baby sucking his pacifier with the base across the room from his crib, and that\'s not even something I normally hear when I\'m with him.  Having two receivers is wonderful, I don\'t have to move one from room to room depending on where I\'ll be.  And not having batteries in the base really doesn\'t matter, because if the electricity is out, there\'s nothing else in the house to make noise that would prevent you from hearing baby.  It\'s not interrupted by our high powered cordless phones or the video monitor, either.  I highly recommend it!",5
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,After reading the reviews I was very worried about all of the problems I read about.  I have not however encountered any of these with this monitor.  This monitor comes in very clear you can even hear the baby breathing!  I like the dual monitors I leave one in a stationary location and the other I carry around with me.  This way I have one on with the electricity but can also use a battery in the mobile one.  Once I read the reviews and decided on this monitor I did have trouble finding it.  I found it at Target.  I would definitly buy this product again.,5
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,"I\'m a fan of Graco products in general, and this monitor does not disappoint.  The base is very sensitive, so it transmits even the smallest sounds from your baby\'s room.  The dual receivers work even when on different floors from the transmitter - in our 3-level, 2,400 sq ft house there\'s no spot I\'ve found that doesn\'t get reception.  Best of all, the frequency doesn\'t cross our phones, computer network or any of our other electronics.  Highly recommended!!",5
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,"After trying 2 other monitors, this one is wonderful.  It gets great reception inside and out (I can get some yard work done!).  I have a 2-story house with a basement and get reception on all 3 levels.  Excellent product!",5
Safety First Cabinet and Drawer Latches - 12-Pack,"Better then the new model, but still a pain to install and dont work all the time. But still better then the other that breaks the head all the time. If it does not work all the time why do it?",2
Safety First Cabinet and Drawer Latches - 12-Pack,"Personally I found these a hassle to install, ignore the included directions and break out your drill to make pilot holes.  Also difficult to adjust alignment side-to-side, so drill the holes right!  Works great for cabinets once installed correctly.  I gave up on installing them in drawers.",3
Safety First Cabinet and Drawer Latches - 12-Pack,We purchased these--fairly easy to install as long as you have a drill.  Keeping baby out so far.  Used when tot locks were to hard to locate with magnet-better than them by far.,3
Safety 1St/Dorel Oven Lock 241 Child Safety,"I like the lock, however the sticky tape that comes with it does not hold well.  I need to get some better tape and then it may stay on better.  It does at lease deter my daughter and she hasn\'t tried to open it since I put it on the oven.",3
Safety 1St/Dorel Oven Lock 241 Child Safety,"This item won\'t attach to a regular stove because the adhesive won\'t stick to the sides.  Also, it comes unlocked too easily if you can manage to get it to stick to the oven.",2
Safety 1St/Dorel Oven Lock 241 Child Safety,"We love this oven lock. It does what it is supposed to and the adhesive seems to be working extremely well. It was hard to attach at first because there are three pieces and with only two hands it\'s hard to hold all the pieces where they need to go. It doesn\'t get too hot to touch when the oven is on, which is great so that I can have it locked while I\'m cooking and then unlock it without getting burned to take the food out.",5
Safety 1St/Dorel Oven Lock 241 Child Safety,Does what it is supposed to.  Basic and easy too use and little ones can\'t figure it out.,5
Blind Cord Wind Ups,"If you\'re using them to simply get the cords out of reach then they\'ll likely be ok.  However, if you will actually be raising and lowering the blinds then these DO NOT work at all.",1
Blind Cord Wind Ups,This works but it is just a container to hold the cords.  It does not wind and unwind without opening.  We ended up just cutting our cords to shorten them.,2
Blind Cord Wind Ups,Do not waste your money or time on these-completely useless this product is garbage! They are being returned anything would work better than this,1
Blind Cord Wind Ups,"I bought these for my plantation blinds.  If you have lightweight venetian blinds with very short cords, this might be useful.  I can not wind up enough cord to shorten it enough to keep out of reach. And if I do get it short enough, then when I try to actually open the blinds this thing pops off.  they are hard to keep on.  Also, if they are within reach of the child, they create a strangulation hazard because they create a loop.  I am going to replace these with cleats next to my windows.",1
Blind Cord Wind Ups,"these do get the job done.... if you have really long cords they still hang down pretty low, but they still are high enough to keep out of my son\'s reach. before i just had a nail up on the wall and had the string up on it, and that did the trick too, but this is a bit easier. (my son is 15 months) I for the life of me could not figure out how to put the dang thing together. the package instructions didnt make sense to me, and i even looked up instructions online. maybe i\'m just blonde, i dont know. I was just horribly confused. i ended up just doing what i thought looked right, and it worked out, but i\'m not sure if it\'s the ""correct"" way. it was very inexpensive and it got the job done, so overall i\'m pretty happy with it. just wish it went up higher. I guess for the money, I would recommend it.",3
Blind Cord Wind Ups,"I\'ve had these up on my windows for about 3 months now and have had no problems with them falling off or anything. My son hasn\'t tried to pull at them yet and if he ever does, I dont know how well they will hold up but for the price, they are a pretty gold safety meAsure. They definitely keep the cords wound up above his reach so hopefully pulling on them wont ever be an issue anyway. So yeah, no complaints here",4
Blind Cord Wind Ups,TOTALLY Useless! The 2 pieces will not stay together when you put any kind of pressure on the cord.  Get some retrofits at Window Coverings Safety Council instead!,1
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,"I had my first un-interrupted restaurant dinner after I used this hook-on chair.  My 6-month old daughter just sat there, watched us eat, happily banging on the tray with her little hands without wanting to be held.  Absolutely the best money I have ever spent on a baby product!",5
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,"I can\'t say enough good things about this chair!!  We love it!  It is really easy to use on a wide range of tables.  We mainly use it at our bar, but it fits well on all of the tables we\'ve tried it on so far.  It is a great thing to have for going to dinner with friends or family.  It also comes in handy when having company with a small child as one can use this and the other can use the high chair.  Folds up easily to travel.The tray is a bit tough to get on and off, but that is probably good so that the child can\'t pinch their fingers.I do have one complaint and that is regarding the strap. It is the kind that has one center piece and the two side straps snap into the center.  It holds the child in securely, but doesn\'t always come unsnapped on one side very easily.  I also have a Graco swing with the same snap &amp; have had the same problem.  This can be a bit frustrating, but is definitely not enough to keep me from highly recommending this item!",5
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,We bought this chair to use in our motorhome and now we use it everywhere.  We always take to the restaurants with us.  It works great on most sturdy tables and we love when we get a booth.  Our son was also able to use it earlier than the restaurant chairs because it has a higher back on it and he is always at the right level with the table.  Another feature I love is that he has his own tray (which can be removed).  This way he always has a clean place to eat!!  We highly recommend this product.,5
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,"We absolutely LOVE our Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock Chair!!  Our son is 9 months old and we have most certainly already got our money worth!We love that fact that every time we eat out we know that he\'s eating on a clean surface. He is always buckled in and I don\'t need to worry about the germs that are on the restaurant high chairs.  We can very easily sit in a booth, which is definitely more comfortable than sitting at a table.We take this chair with us everywhere.  When we fly to visit relatives, it comes right along with us.  It easily fits into our suitcase and doesn\'t take a lot of room.  It connects to almost every single table!!You do need to be careful with some tables, as they can be flimsy and move. In cases like that, I plop my husband across from my son and all is well!I highly recommend this chair to EVERYONE, it\'s a must have!",5
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,We got this to take when we visit grandma or eat out. Now my daughter insists on sitting in it at home. We have put the high chair away and this seat is a great space saver! It\'s super easy to set up and remove from the table which makes cleaning a breeze.,5
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,We like this seat and it allows the baby to be part of the family.  One problem... your table must be flat on the underside... I have a table I intended this for that has framing between the four legs only  about three inches in from the side of the table... this makes this chair unusable.  You need about 7 inches on the underside of your table that are flat for the chair to be properly set up.,4
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,"I saw this while browsing and decided to get it on a whim, and I am so pleased with it. It is very nice to take into restaurants and you KNOW your highchair is clean. It puts them at your level and they feel part of the family. I love that it has a tray so again, sanitary eating surface. The plastic is easy to wipe down, but we haven\'t had any big messes to clean from the crevices, so I can\'t complain about that yet. It feels very secure once attached and the only thing to watch is that the table won\'t tip from the unbalanced weight. Two things I wish were easier, first, depending on the table thickness, we sometimes have to put the chair part-way on and put our daughter in before securing it tightly to the table, so it really takes 2 of us to do it safely. She just can\'t maneuver into the seat otherwise. And second, it is a bit bulky even though it folds almost flat. It folds to about 12&quot;x24&quot; (I am guessing, don\'t quote that) but we just leave it in the cargo area of the SUV and it\'s not bad. Really is a hassle when carrying the baby, diaper bag, and this seat at the same time, so I use it only when I have someone to help me. Once in place, it has been a wonderful purchase! Well worth the effort!",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,Works great but beyond a nightmare to install. Get ready for a learning curve perhaps 30mins for the first then 15 for the rest by the time you install and adjust doors to work well. Once in fantastic!,4
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"My husband and I installed these and experienced the same problem as the previous reviewer. The magnet seemed too weak to work well. But the set includes extensions.  The hole needs to be drilled deep enough so that the magnet comes close to the front of the cabinet door. (I suggest putting a piece of masking tape on the drill bit, so that you can make the hole deep enough without going through the cabinet door.)  When the hole is deep enough & the extension used, it works well.  And there\'s even a latch to keep it unlocked, if you want to keep it unlocked without uninstalling the whole thing.",4
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"Magnets rule.  These things may be a more challenging install but if you think it through and go slow they do indeed work as advertised.  Just don\'t try to do it in a hurry or with your toddler ""supervising"" because you will get distracted, break something, and/or teach them a new word or two!Some tips that may save some time and energy, both of which you obviously need considering aforementioned toddler.GET THE FULL SIZE INSTRUCTION SHEET!Yes yes, the instruction sheet blows.  Even laser eye surgery won\'t help you see the diagrams clearly enough.  But after a bit of hunting I found a PDF of them online which you can ZOOM into and see everything MUCH clearer!  Go to the safety first website at safety1st.com and search for instructions for product number 71175.  Print, have a beer and read em through.Consider all surfaces before installation:The top frame of our sink cabinet had stuff in the way and the double doors don\'t have a center post.  Doh.  But after a time-out and another beer, I realized I could  try attaching the strike plate to the inside bottom of the cabinet and it works just as well.  So before thinking it doesn\'t work, ignore the diagrams and evaluate which edge will work best.From experience... avoid drilling 4 holes then re-drilling 4 more:SKIP the second part of Instruction #2 that says to mark the 4 holes for the lock first.  Just drill the center hole for the magnet plunger thingy  first.  I did as the instructions say and because I was a bit off on the center hole (remember the beer) all 4 of those holes were useless.  On subsequent installs, I would insert the lock (good time to test it too) and then once it\'s all groovy, use the actual lock in position to mark and pre-drill the 4 holes to attach the lock to the cabinet.Save money:  use fewer Tot Loks on double doors:Before you buy 20 of these... One money saver idea...  if you have any cabinets that have ""double doors"" that meet in the middle, you can reduce your costs by just using a tot lok on one of them, then place an inexpensive sliding surface bolt or other interior cabinet latch (from any hardware store) on the inside of the second door.  Open one, reach over and pop the second one when you need that side open.  I did this on the lesser used, garbage disposal side of the sink cabinet and thus impressed the wife with my unusual frugality and common sense.Hope this is helpful!",4
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"As previous reviewers have stated, these locks are very difficult to install. Mine did come with a drill bit stop, but I had to go buy the right bit for the drill. Then the stop did not work, it was too loose on the bit, even though we bought the size suggested in the instructions. This resulted in drilling through one cabinet door. Then on the second door, despite being very careful, my husband drilled through even with the stop on the bit. After some measuring, we came to the realization that the lock would only work if installed in a spot where the front of the cabinet was cut in to give it a paneled/beveled look. This makes the door too narrow, so that the lock is impossible to install without drilling all the way through it. We still have this lock on the doors we drilled through, because it works well and we have not been able to get replacement doors yet, we can\'t find them! So yes, it works great once installed. If you have thick doors and don\'t mind the hassle, go ahead and get them. Otherwise keep looking.",3
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"We have 5 of the Tot-Loks and 2 magnets.  Three of the locks are in the bathroom and 2 protect the chemicals under the sink.  The installation of the locks took a little more time than other systems, but only took 30 minutes to install all the locks.  We have some friends that use the locks that you have to push down the arm to get the door open, they are always complaining that their toddler smashing his finger trying to get the door open.  Don\'t have to worry about smashed fingers with these locks.  Also don\'t have to worry about glue from adhesives ruining the front of your cabinets.  Once removed there is only a small hole on the inside of the door.  We don\'t lock our drawers since we do not keep any knives in the drawers, so I can\'t state how well they work on drawers.  But they are a great product and have suggested them to anyone with a toddler or expecting.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"I saw a few negative reviews on these locks that made me hesitant to purchase them, but when my 18 month old son came in the living room holding the freeze off wart can, that was it! They have such little arms and fingers; he reached right under the sink that had the traditional plastic child proof locks. I bought the 2 pack to try it and was so very careful because as some of the reviews said, you can drill right on through the cabinet and that is quite true, I almost did it on the first one I did. I blame my husband for distracting me, but I was holding the drill. Take it slow and BE CAREFUL! Consider turning the speed of your drill down so it doesn\'t get away on you. It\'s worth it, and as long as you use the little magnet extenders they give you, it will work awesome! As for being tricky, yes you have to read the directions. The first one took me about 30 minutes to figure out, but then it was easy! I ordered more and I just now put 2 more on, in about 10 minutes and they work super! If you need extra keys like we did, consider buy another couple of 2 packs, you pay $7.99 for an extra key and only get the key. For 3 bucks more you can get 2 more locks and the key and put them maybe in the kitchen where you have more cabinets. Just stick the key on the fridge, high up away from little fingers and you always know where it is! I\'m very impressed with this safety lock system and won\'t use anything else.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"I wouldn\'t consider myself a handyman at all, and these locks were easy to install. It seems like people who had a problem installing these either A)were afraid of/didn\'t know how to use a drill B)had abnormally thick cabinets or C)didn\'t read the instructions.  Just follow the instructions, and you\'ll be fine.  Our cabinets don\'t budge an inch, and I\'m confident that my daughter won\'t be able to pry them open.  Heck, I can\'t pry them open.  They are more expensive than the other kinds, so we just got these for our cabinets that have sharp objects or chemicals in them.  For the other drawers and cabinets, we just used the cheap, plastic hooks.Overall, very good, very effective, and very easy to install.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"Love these. Not the easiest to install and they may take a little getting used to, but so worth it! They are really secure and do not interfere with the appearance of your cabinets. Would recommend in a heartbeat!",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"Being a woman and I installed 5 locks by myself it wasn\'t that bad.  This is the best thing I ever bought.  It takes some thinking and organizing and then you are on your way.  You cannot just start drilling, you have to study the pictures and the instructions.  But at the end it pays off.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"I guess we should have known, having had poor experiences with Safety First products in the past, but even with that past experience, we were dumbfounded at the cheaply made, poorly designed garbage that is this system.  I guess, if you don\'t love your children, and you don\'t care for your beautiful cabinetry, go out and buy one of these....or five.  We installed it, it didn\'t work.  We returned it.  We are very unhappy!",1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,These were impossible to install.  We ended up returning them.  My husband builds his own furniture and is very handy with tools.  He could not get these to work if his life depended on it.,1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"This is a wonderful product!  I tried several brands of the traditional plastic cupboard toddler locks and they kept breaking or the cupboard could still be pulled open.  Tot lok is strong and unopenable without the key.  Plus, it does not compromise the look of my cupboards either.  The instructions are easy to follow for proper installation.  I can\'t say enough about this great product!  Highly reccommended!",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"I bought this to defeat the prying hands of my 2 year old. I lost.The device is phenomenal in concept and even drilling holes did not deter me. I was able to get this to work fabulously for cabinets and pieces of wood under 1.125"" thick--before you add the ""Extension Slug"". In a sentence, any cabinet thicker than 1.125"" is entirely non-functional.The magnet that comes with the lock is great and strong--and activates the lock consistently across the 3 packs of locks I bought through 1/8"" of wood so long as you\'re not using the extension slug. The extension pin, however is fully functional. Once you add the extension slug, the device stops working entirely.",1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"We tried the tab and hook kind, where you push down the tab to disengage it from the hook, but those still allow your kid (and you) to get your finger smashed in the drawer, and kids figure them out pretty quick. Even the small gap needed to get your finger in to depress the tab is like a mile wide gap for small hands.  Installing them is a bear, with lots of trial and error, and usually no templates to help you. They also tend to collect grime, and they break or loosen up a lot over time.These are great!  The doors/drawers remain firmly shut until the magnetic lock is disengaged with the ""key"".  The directions are good, and they include a sticky template for each lock.  I will say that you need to read the instructions and make sure how your hardware is supposed to be lined up. I screwed up the first one I ever did, which was more me hurrying and screwing up some spacial relations as far as what direction things needed to be in than bad instructions.  After that the rest (we have quite a few of these installed) went smoothly.The sticky templates are especially helpful making sure everything is where it\'s supposed to be. If you have thick doors (we have really thick, hardwood cabinet doors) they have extender slugs that effectively lengthen the magnetic catch.  Even if you have to have a handyman install these they\'re well worth it!One note: It does take some trial and error to get the hang of what spot you have to pass the ""key"" over to disengage the lock. But you get the hang of it quickly.",5
Secure Grip Door Knob Covers,"Assuming your child was born with 2 functioning hands, don\'t waste your money.  My cat could figure these things out.",1
Secure Grip Door Knob Covers,This product is great!  Keeps two year old out of pantry and basement door.  Don\'t have to worry about her falling down the basement stairs as she can open all other doors with ease.,5
Secure Grip Door Knob Covers,"The hole in the middle is just the right size for little fingers to get in. My son realized this immediately. They manufacturers really need to think of a more clever design. The covers did however successfully keep me out when I needed to open the door. I therefore think it should be called ""parentproof"".",2
Secure Grip Door Knob Covers,"This product works but it is cheap plastic and won\'t last long and if you don\'t have large doorknobs the product is much too big.  The package says it should spin freely on the knob but on our doorknobs it sags too.  This would be fine for larger knobs, though only if there is adequate supervision as well, because I think a determined child could break the plastic given a bit of time.",2
Secure Grip Door Knob Covers,"I have a 2 year old, that ended up walking down the driveway with this on the door. I was watering my flowers, and she was in the house with Daddy and sissy, next thing I know, she is standing right next to me laughing. I brought her back in the house, and watched as she opened the door as quickly as I do. Doesn\'t stop her at all, doesn\'t even slow her down.",1
Secure Grip Door Knob Covers,"These knob covers worked well at our house, from when our kids were 1 1/2 til they were 4 and more.  They are intended to fit loosely over your door knob, so the cover spins freely when a child touches it, and the knob doesn\'t turn.  Your child should not be able to open the door until they are taller, and their hands are bigger, to be able to press buttons on opposite sides of the knob cover at the same time.After the covers were over a year old, we replaced a few because the rubber on the inside was getting sticky and so the covers gripped too much, and the knob could be turned by a child tall enough to press down on the top.When our kids were 4, the tallest one began to be able to open the doors with these covers on.  But they got us through the most difficult years, when saying ""no"" isn\'t enough to stop the kids going to unsafe areas.Our kids are now 5 years old (triplets), and we still have these knob covers on our doors to go outside.  Those doors are stiff and heavy enough that the kids can\'t open them without help.  And we are glad they can\'t leave the house without us knowing about it!It\'s too bad these don\'t work for all kids, for all doors.  But for the modest price, it\'s worth trying them.  You might get a lot of peace of mind.",4
Safety 1st Seat Belt Adjuster,"This is a good way to get the shoulder strap off your neck without any fuss.  There isn\'t too much more to say, except your small person will love not having the shoulder strap around their neck any more.",4
Safety 1st Seat Belt Adjuster,These are not just for children. I used mine all the time. It really helps to keep the shoulder strap from grabbing you across the neck. It is so much more comfortable to wear a seat belt now. I have bought several as gift for friends and they love them too.,5
Safety 1st Seat Belt Adjuster,"This item is NOT SAFE.  The lap belt portion of the seat belt should rest on the hips/thighs of the passenger.  Devices like this can cause the lap belt to ride up onto the soft part of the abdomen, which can cause serious internal injuries in a crash.  If your child is too short to use the seatbelt properly (no putting it behind their back, and no shoulder belt across the neck/face) they should still be in a booster seat!  Most children are not ready for just a seatbelt until they are at least 8 years old and 80 pounds.  Take the money you would put towards this product and get a booster seat instead.",1
Safety 1st Seat Belt Adjuster,"I ordered five of these so that my disabled son would have this seat belt adjuster in every car he rides in.  It is easy to install, easy to adjust and stays in place well.  My son is 12, and needs to be secured in the seat belt without it choking him.  It took him a little while to adjust to it, but now it\'s not even an issue.  He has used it in all five cars, and we have all been pleased with it - especially for the price!  I am very pleased with this product and would reccommend it to anyone.",5
Safety 1st Seat Belt Adjuster,I have two of these adjusters and have been using them since my kids were 5 years old.  They take a few minutes to put on properly but they work and the kids can clip themselves in....Yeah!!!!  They are excellent when traveling!!!  I will be buying yet another one in a few months.,4

Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,My husband finally installed the magnetic locks and I absolutely love them.  I can\'t comment on the installation as I stayed away for that part but the locks work great. I love the fact that you don\'t have to open a drawer or door and smash your finger in the process of trying to unlock it. I believe this is item is well worth the price.,5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"This is a very nice product, and does exactly what you\'d expect it to do. My only two gripes are: (1) It\'s true that the first one is hard to install. The instructions are a bit hard to follow, and I think an adhesive version would be a big seller. (2) The extra kets are expensive. Otherwise, I really, really like the product. It\'s exactly what I was looking for, completely invisible, and my child can\'t possibly defeat this unless we leave the key within reach. Buy an extra key with the kit or you won\'t be able to get in either if and when you lose the enclosed key. A regular refrigerator magnet will NOT work as a emergency back up key.",4
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"My sister and brother-in-law had these and I wanted some too.  I wish I would have read the many negative reviews on these before I purchased them and drilled holes in my kitchen drawers.  The bottom line is, like many of the negative reviewers point out, these will not, and do not work on hard wood solid drawers.  They may work for cabinet doors only, and after my experience I would be skeptical of those as well unless they are really cheap plywood cabinets.  The idea behind these is they open by using a magnetic key that, in theory, unlocks the locking mechanism by placing the magnet on the front front of the drawer or door. However it is not powerful enough to pass through the outsides of my drawers to engage the mechanism (and I drilled ""drill bit is not included"" almost to the very edge of the front of my drawer.  That is going through a half inch of solid wood of the drawer cover, and also a half inch of the interior of the drawer. I even used the extra metal extender slug included in the package.  Nada. They do not work and there is nothing I can do to make them work.  The bad part is I bought them through ebay.  Lesson learned there.  Cannot return them. I am really not sure if these are even designed for drawers.  Be warned folks.",1
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"This a great tool to keep toddlers out of cabinets. I\'ve tried the product that latches on the cabinet or drawers and I found them harder to install. This install can be rather tricky but it\'s worth it once they are in place. It comes with a guide to help you figure out where the screws go, the main tricky part is drilling the required hole and stopping just before you go all the way through your cabinet. Although it comes with a piece that helps you know where to stop, you have to do one cabinet to figure this out first.",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"So far so good after a couple of weeks. Just be careful not to drill your pilot holes to deep because the screws are short. Made the mistake on the first one, but after that one it went smoothly. The templet was perfect and all works well.And it\'s child pull tested.  She is a strong one and has been testing it out.",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"This is simply a great product.  It is installed inside the cabinet so there is nothing to see from the front.  The newer models work even easier than the original ones we purchased years ago.  They open easily when the magnet is put near (don\'t even need to touch the cabinet door).  We use these in several places over the house and love the convenience, but piece of mind it gives.  They are also pretty strong - our 3 1/2 year old pulls and tries to open sometimes and has not broken or pulled open any drawer.NOTE - The old version needed a drill to make a small hole on the lock which sits inside the door, but the newer ones like this no longer require that hole to be made. These work better and are easier to install - just need a screwdriver and a few minutes.",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"Such a great idea but...installation is ridiculously difficult but I suffered through to protect my child.  I ended up with holes in my nice furniture and a system that will not work.  My entertainment center is a hardwood, maybe that\'s a factor I don\'t know, but my cabinets aren\'t thick enough for the extension slug so I\'m at a loss.  Maybe I\'ll look for a stronger magnet and try again since the damage is already done.Oh well I guess that\'s why they make wood filler and stain, just add that to my list of a million projects.",1
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"My husband and I had some trouble installing these. As others have said before, make sure you swipe the key over the lock BEFORE closing the door to ensure that it works properly (it should click and release easily). If not, you might end up like we did being completely locked out of our cabinet! When I called customer service, they were not helpful at first and suggested I find a stronger magnet to open the door. I kept asking to speak with someone who knew the product well. Finally, I spoke with a wonderful representative who told me the problem was probably that I had not drilled far enough into the cabinet. I was able to pull the door open just enough to fit a thin, metal shish-kabob skewer between the door and the lock to release the lock. We drilled a bit deeper into the cabinet and it worked! Now, these locks work beautifully. As soon as we slide the key over the area, it unlocks quickly and easily. Also, make sure to measure the depth of the cabinet and add the extra slugs as recommended. We really like these locks! It is so easy to keep them in the unlocked position for times when there are no children in the house.",4
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,Set up is a bit timely but they are great. We bought a house that had them just needed a few more. The lock an be deactivated which is really convenient.,5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"My son\'s first reaction to his new \'big boy\' furniture was to open the drawers and climb up.  We tried the lesser expensive spring locks, but he can still open the drawers a little bit and climb up.  That\'s when I found the tot locks and the drawers do not budge unless you have the key.  I love the option where he can\'t pry the drawer open to climb.  Spring locks are good in our kitchen for easy frequent access, but for a bedroom tot locks are perfect!  I\'ve read reviews where they are difficult to install, I had no issues at all with directions or install.",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"We tried Safety 1st\'s alternative cabinet lock, the kind you press down with your fingers just inside the cabinet door, as well as Tot Lok. We put some of each system on various cabinets in the kitchen. Tot Lok is vastly superior to the other kind. It works every time instead just most of the time; it makes it impossible for our 18-month-old to smash her fingers in the drawers and cabinets; it is strong and secure.",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,These are great for keeping the little ones out. They don\'t require much to install. There is a template included so you get everything lined up perfectly the first time and drill your holes in the correct space. That\'s right if you don\'t want to add holes to your cabinet then these aren\'t for you. They are easy to disengage and they have an unlock switch for when you don\'t have to worry about the little one getting into the cabinet.,5

I\'m one of those guys that kees hard. drive magnnets around and I\'m using that until I get the 2 magnets I just ordered.Also, If your kids are acrobats, you should look at mounting a cupboad hook in the cieling away from climbable objects.  Hang a key ring where both adults can reach it with arm fully extended and tha should solve the snack pilferage ;)",4
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Magnetic Key,This key has more magnetism than the one that came in the kit.  Key will actually hold on the outside of the cabinet door and seems to unlock with more authority.  Like it.  Keep the original kit key as a spare.,5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Magnetic Key,"I\'d have to suggest that the other reviews were either sour grapes over the price of the magnet alone (reasonable, and I can\'t figure out why a magnet alone is so much compared to a kit with locks included) or a misunderstanding about how the product works.The reviewer who downrated because ""it\'s only a magnet"" may not realize that the lock itself if MECHANICAL (plastic interfaces that interlock) with a MAGNETIC RELEASE.  The drawer/cabinet is NOT kept closed via magnet.I might suggest moving over to the kits that contain the magnet along with the locks, however.  You\'ll need several magnets unless you are locking multiple cabinets in the same room.",5

Safety 1st Hospital\'s Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,This thermometer is awful.  I tired several times to get a reading on myself and my husband and it always read 93 degrees or below.

Safety 1st Hospital\'s Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"I\'m not sure why everyone seems to be having trouble finding covers, I found mine at my local [store] (and it\'s a tiny store).

Safety 1st Hospital\'s Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"This thermometer does appear to be accurate (when tested on myself), however it is very difficult to use on an infant.  My daughter is 3 months old now, and I still find it difficult (and a little scary) to use on her.  She wiggles around so much that the scanner is usually out of her ear before it is done.  I am also hesitant to use it in fear that she will jerk her head and end up getting poked in the ear or eye.  I think it will get plenty of use - just not yet.",3
Safety 1st Hospital\'s Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"I bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born. It is AWFUL! It gives strange readings like 94.5 and 95.1, when in fact I know that she has a fever! I bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings. Don\'t buy this, its a waste of time and $$$$$$!",1
Safety 1st Hospital\'s Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,I was a little worried when I read these reviews about not being able to find replacement covers after I had already received this thermometer.  So I went to Babies R Us to look into exchanging it and I found 10-12 packages of 20 ea. replacement covers for this very model.  I then found them at Wal-Mart as well.  I just wanted to let all those that are having a problem know this!  Good luck.,4

First it was 95.5 and then 98.5 and then 96.2, etc.  I tested it on myself, my daughter and my husband.  Then I gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe I just wasn\'t doing it correctly and he had the same results.  I have taken it back to Target and am trying a different brand.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!",1
Safety 1st Hospital\'s Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"This product is advertised in a misleading fashion:it says that it is for all ages but it is not.  Unfortunately I did not find that out until attempting to use it on my sister\'s visiting sick 12 week old baby.It\'s scary enough dealing with a baby\'s fever without hearing from every doctor that you talk to that the thing is inaccurate on infants. This should be acknowledged in the packaging not (as it is) buried in the fine print of the directions. It is also very difficult to follow the instructions, and we wasted quite a few of the probe covers trying to figure it out.DON&quot;T BUY THIS AS PREPARATION FOR A NEW BABY. Go the old-fashioned rectal thermometer way, that\'s what your pediatrician would recommend.",1
Safety 1st Hospital\'s Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,i was given this thermometer for a shower gift and boy does it come in handy. The only problem i have had with it so far is finding replacement lens covers.  For all those who dont know how to change it from C to F it is really easy.  make sure the unit is off press the &quot;m&quot; it will show wether it is in &quot;f&quot; or &quot;c&quot; then turn the unit on and press &quot;m&quot; to change.  And for all those buying unit it is extremely important to save all the manuals.,4
Safety 1st Hospital\'s Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"I would like to ditto (and thank!) the reviewer who suggested the CVS brand covers.  After reading her review, I purchased the covers from cvs.com . Then I thought about checking at Walgreen\'s, and sure enough, they carry them (same price as CVS, 40 for $5.99).  I just picked up a box today.  So I will soon have a bunch of covers, but I don\'t care.  I just love this thermometer.  I actually have the one with the light on it.  Outstanding product.",5
Safety 1st Hospital\'s Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"I don\'t usually bother complaining about products, but this thermometer was such a waste of $, I just wanted to save someone else the trouble. The temperature readings on this are SOOO inaccurate. EVERY time that we check a temp. it is different, it varies alot. Just to see if it worked we tried 8 times in a row on ourselves to see what we got. Every time it was different sometimes by a few degrees. It reads low sometimes, so you may have a temperature and not be aware. And we couldn\'t even take it back to the store. Do yourself a favor by the regular digital thermometer.We didn\'t have any luck with a diffferent brand either, the ear ones are all off, but not as bad as this one.",1

Hospital\'s Choice Fold Up Nail Clippers,"On the first use of this item a sliver of metal fell off.  If I was not in a well lit room and paying close attention, my 7 week old could have gotten seriously hurt.  To add salt to the wound,  I tried to return the item and I got two separate emails from the seller.  The first email asked me to describe the defect.  I responded to the email. After which, I received a second email asking me to send a picture of the item; SERIOUSLY!  1. Do you think I am storing the sliver of metal to take a picture of it?  2.  If I described the defect as a sliver of metal, the product would look the same as in the original picture of the item, as a sliver denotes a very small piece, so the seller already has a picture of what the product looks like.  3.  If the seller needed a picture, this should have been requested in the first email, not in a second email.  I shop online because I have limited time.  I do not have time to respond to an email trail for a $3 nail clip.  However, I am so irritated with the product and the seller\'s response that I decided to write this review.

The emery board is useful.- Dubon baby nail clipper (the kind that you wear on your finger like a ring) - has the safety guard so you don\'t catch the baby\'s skin in the clippers, but that makes it almost impossible to clip the actual nail.  Plus, it\'s not sharp and therefore worthless.- Nuby infant nail clipper - not bad in terms of sharpness, but something about the way it\'s designed makes it really difficult to get at the baby\'s nails.Search ends here, thank goodness!",5
Safety 1st Digital Pacifier Thermometer,"It is always difficult getting a reading from a thermometer for a sick infant. With this product, given that the infant would be used to a pacifer, works wonders. For all of my friends expecting a little one, this is a must.",5
Safety 1st Digital Pacifier Thermometer,"When I bought this item, I thought this was a really clever way to take a baby\'s temperature.  I use this thermometer only on occasion.  It\'s convenient, but it requires about 3 minutes before a final temperature is reached.  It requires that your baby keep it in his mouth for that long.  It\'s getting harder for my baby to accept this ""pacifier"", now that she is on the larger, 6-month-plus sized pacifiers.  Also, check with your doctor about how to take accurate readings: our pediatrician said that a rectal thermometer was the most accurate for the early weeks of her life.",4
Safety 1st Digital Pacifier Thermometer,"The thermometer only worked one time and then the battery died, and you cannot replace the battery.  This is a waste of money.  We only had it for five months and it is useless already.",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"We received this as a baby shower gift (after registering for it). I had hoped it would work in our kitchen sink and then fold up to store easily in our small house. However, it doesn\'t fit well in the sink -- either the sink is too small or too deep as it would leave the tub hanging only by the fold-up sides. And, like another reviewer said, it leaks and doesn\'t hold much water.While I fully understand that babies and children tend to make a mess, a slippery floor and a slippery baby aren\'t what I\'d prefer to have at the same time.It also doesn\'t quite seem big enough. My son is only 8 weeks old and there\'s already not enough room for his legs and feet. (Granted, he was 9lbs 3oz to begin with and just keeps growing.)I think I\'ll be buying a bigger, bulkier tub soon - as he\'s still too young for me to feel comfortable bathing him in the sink and my back and knees can\'t take putting this tub in the bathtub.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub is convenient because I can fold it up and store it under my son\'s dresser.  My son was a big baby....well over 9 pounds by the time of his first tub bath, and now he is almost 14 pounds at 7 weeks.  His head constantly slides to the side, and there is only hard plastic on the sides, so, bath time has not been a fun experience.  I am going to start putting a rolled towel on the side, so that his head willl be cushioned.  They should have thought of this, and made a head cushion out of the foam liner, but, I don\'t know of many tubs where this wouldn\'t be the same problem.  As far as holding only a little water, I just let the water run the whole time he is in the tub, and leave the drain open, so he has a constant stream of clean, warm water on him.",3
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub was given as a gift for our first baby.  Along with it, we were given one of those bath sponges that you lay in the tub and then set the baby in.  We couldn\'t have been happier with it.  It was shallow enough that with the sponge, the baby was snuggled just right.  She didn\'t slide anywhere.  It fit right onto our kitchen sink and when she was a little older we would put some water in our big bathtub and then put her into it with her tub.  She was still secure in her tub but able to enjoy her bath even more.",4
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"In my opinion this is the best tub for babies. It fit perfect on my kitchen sink, which made bath time highly convenient.  It is also the perfect size.  And the foam mat that is inside it made it so baby does not slide around. It is also reclined perfectly to keep baby in the perfect position. I got this for a shower gift for my first baby.  Then I got another tub for my second child 2 yrs later.  I ended up putting away the new one and sending my husband to the storage unit to get this one back out.  I love this tub and would reccommend it to anyone.  The only problem that I would have with it is the foam does not come out so it could harbor bacteria. I just always made sure to rinse it with antibacterial soap and HOT water after every use. No other tub compares!!",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub doesn\'t have any support for the baby\'s head, especailly when they can\'t sit up on their own yet. I have to constantly hold my daughters head to prevent it from falling to the side of the tub which has no paddings. And where she sits in the tub curves too much where she looks like a little ball and I\'m not able to sit her forward or anything to wash her back because she doesn\'t have any more room to bend in the tub. I don\'t know how to describe it in details, but I just recommend all the moms and dads to just walk by this tub when you see it in the store!",3
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I purchased my first Fold-Up Tub back in 1997 when my 1st daughter was born. When she outgrew it, I gave it away.  Then when I had my 2nd daughter, I purchased another one.  I was completely satisfied with the tub, I am currently expecting another baby the last part of January 2002 and WILL purchase another one.  It is so convenient to use and store.  I never had any problems with the ones I bought.  I recommend this to all parents for their babies, it is affordable and works just great.",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub made bathtime horrible! Slip resitant pad my... arm! My baby slid all over the place. Now that he is 2 months he doesn\'t even fit in it anymore. 0-6 months, I don\'t think so! We bought another tub and were much happier, as is our son! Reading the other reviews I may try to use it as an after the bath seat. BEWARE every single complaint (in all the reviews) is well founded!!!!",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I recieved this tub as a gift at my shower. The first time I went to use it, I was alone with the baby. I put the baby in the tub and water started pouring out from the hinges. It was horrible. I tried it again and it did the same thing, even with a tiny amount of water. Please, don\'t waste your money.",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS 2 MONTHS OLD. NOW 8 MONTHS STILL USING IT. I LIKED THAT IT FOLDED UP FOR EASY STORAGE.  SOME OF THE OTHER BABY BATH TUBS ARE SO BIG AND BULKY. IT ALSO IS VERY STURDY.,5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This is OK for the short time that I am actually going to use it because it does get the job done.  However:-it does not hold a lot of water, so the water gets cool fast-the cusion is not that soft so I still have to put my hand under my babies headThe good news is:-it folds for easy storage-it has a little area for you to put the bathing items that you use such as some soap, wash cloth, or toys",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub works fine.  It does not pose any safty hazard and is better than just puting baby straight into the tub, but be aware that it does have some problems.  Firstly, it is difficult to keep your baby (who cannot sit - which is the whole purpose of the tub) from drooping over to the side.  It also brags that it is a space saver, but to me that is like a bicycle advertising itself as a space saver simply because the basket on the handle bars is removable...in other words it is an exaggeration.  Lastly, after awhile, the bottom yellow pad starts peeling up and you can not get it to stick back down....I don\'t feel ripped off or anything, but I am having another baby now and replacing it with a better one.  This one won\'t even make it to the garage sale...it is going in the trash.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I bought this tub because it  folded up. However, I hate it. It\'s hard to fill with water and there are trenchs on either side were my baby gets her foot stuck. The biggest problem I have is where the tub folds there is an open space that some how my baby keeps putting her hand in and getting scrapped.",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I bought this for size convienence. While its folding feature is very useful, I had to buy a bath sponge to put under my son because the foam liner was NOT slip resistant. My son slides all over. It did fit in my sink well, though, and the drain plug is useful. My son is 6mos and 25 inches and is about to grow out of it, but the tub does say 0-6 mos, so I guess it\'s time for a bath seat. I guess if you decide to purchase it, get a bath pad too!",3
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,We bought this tub for our first child and it was great. We used it first on the counter and then later in the big tub so that our son would be used to the running water sound (which can be scary to a young child). It is so compact and easy to store. I didn\'t want a bulky tub to try to store when I wasn\'t using it in our apartment. I kept this bath and will be using it with our next child we are expecting in a few months! I think this is a great buy and very well priced. Face it you will only be using this for a few months until your child can sit up on his/her own so spending a bunch on a fancy tub just doesn\'t make sense. =),5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"We are ""apartment dwellers"" and the idea of this tub folding up really attracted us to this product.  It IS very compact and fit nicely into a nook in our tiny bathroom.  Buy it does tend to leak at the hinges; I recommend using it inside the sink and not on a counter-top.  It also is very shallow.  It was perfect for those very first baths when you don\'t want too much water in the tub or possibly for a child who does not like baths.  But my son is a bath lover and before he was even 6 weeks old we\'d replaced it with a deeper tub to allow him to stay warmer and also to splash around more.  If I could do it again I\'d save my money (every little bit counts for us!) and just buy a bigger tub to begin with.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,This is a great tun for the price.  I used for my son until he was about 10 months old and thereafter he could sit up in the tub on his own.  It folds up very easily.  I found that using a body spong to line the bottom of this tub made it much easier to keep a slippery infant secure and comfortable.  I was not able to save this item to use with my next baby as the yellow lining inside the tub began to discolor but for the price this was an item that I did not mind throwing out after using it with only one baby.  This tub lacks the bells and whistles of more expensive ones but does the job and does it well.  I would buy this item again when I have another baby.,4
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I registered for the tub because storage is limited in my house.  My husband and I do not like this tub because if you fill it up too high the water spilled out of the sides where it folds up.  It also does not hold very much water.  Only my son\'s bottom is in the water.  His feet and hands are out of the water, so he cannot explore the water with them.  When he was younger his head always leaned to one side and ended up resting on the plastic side of the tub.  I was always worried that he would slip down.  I would recommend buying a different tub.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I like this tub, it fits in my sink well, it folds up nicely. My daughter is 4 months old and still fits in it.",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"We have used this tub for our daughter from birth to now (she is 6 months old). And she was 6 lbs, 14 oz at birth and now is 20 lbs (she\'s a big baby).  I don\'t understand the comments about it leaking at the hinges - it\'s not meant to be that full.  If it was that full it would be dangerous in that if the baby turned their head to the side it would be in the water!  The little reservoir is great at the end to keep ""clean"" water and the plug you can pull anytime is a must.  It fits down in our kitchen sink (and we have used it in other kitchen sinks when traveling - it has fit every one) and you can drain and refill during the bath.  We keep our little one warm by placing a wet, warm washcloth on her belly while we wash her hair (since this tub is in the sink and has the plug to pull - we leave the water running and can -re-warm her washcloth over and over) - a higher water level would be unsafe.  There is nothing I would change about this tub.  We\'d keep using it except our daughter is sitting alone now and we think she\'s ready to play in the big tub.",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I bought this tub for the convience.  I thought having a folding tub to store would be much easier.  My infant gets her feet caught in the sides of the tub and screams!  It hurts her poor feet.  Also she slides all over the place her head usually ends up propped up against the side which is not comfortable.  Also it does not hold much water so you end up having to dump water out just to have enough room to rinse her off and she stays cold the whole time.I would imagine it would not work well for older babies either, it is almost too small for her and she is only 10 lbs.  I hope this helps someone!",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"We first saw this fold-up infant tub in the NICU unit where our baby stayed for her first 4 weeks.  Its ability to be easily stored was a big plus in the hospital, as well as at home.  The NICU nurse recommended that we line any infant tub with one of those baby bath sponges (ours is yellow and in the shape of a bear).  We use our tub in the kitchen sink.  Leaks, pinches and mildew have never been a problem.  Oddly enough, we have found that our baby likes to sit in the tub backwards (once she could hold up her head).  This positon is more upright and also makes it easier to wash her hair.  We use the kitchen sprayer on low and place a washcloth over our baby\'s torso which we frequently re-wet with warm water to keep her from getting cold.  Our baby is still a bit small for 4 months, but we anticipate that this tub will work for several more months.  Our baby loves bath time!- Our baby is now 8 months old and about 16 pounds.  We have used this infant tub up until this point and are just now graduating to the big tub.  This fold-up tub was a great purchase for us!",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub was an excellent purchase for our family. It folds up easily and neatly for a quick trip to grandma\'s house or for storage.One thing I recommend is purchasing a baby contoured body sponge to lay inside the tub as the lining is neither soft nor slip proof (a thick towel would also do the job). We have one and it makes the entire bathing experience a joy as we don\'t have to worry about holding our son is a safe position while we bathe him. The tub folds and unfolds easily and has no problems leaking. We live a California so we don\'t worry about the tub not being deep enough to allow the water to cover our baby completely, but if you lived in a colder area I might think about purchasing another tub that can keep your baby covered by more warm water.",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"because it folds up, it doesn\'t hold enough water to cover baby to keep him warm.  Nice portability however.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I thought that this tub looked neat because it folded up for easy storage and it had a foam cushion already in it, plus the price was great! This was the worst purchase I have made.  My baby looked like she was &quot;folded&quot; when I put her in the bathtub and she slid sideways, because there arent any adjustments to the tub, so you can\'t raise it up and down.  I would advice anyone looking for a tub to just purchase a 3 in 1 tub.",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"There were definitely problems w/this tub. My baby\'s feet did get stuck in the hinges as others have mentioned. Also, if you try to put much water in it, it leaks. Try to shop around. Since my baby has gotten bigger, the little bather stands have worked best for us. This tub made us dread bath time.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This a great tub. fits in the sink great, I purchased a small sponge to lay her on so she would not slip. I love that if folds up saves space. Only problem is shes getting to big for it  My daughter loves her tub time !!!",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"The good features of this tub:stores easily-takes up very little spacehas a nice sponge pad to reduce slippinghas a little holding area at baby\'s feet for soap, sponge, etc.Unfortunately, the bad features are pretty bad:maximum water level is only high enough to keep a 7-week-old\'s bottom wet (and warm) - the rest is all out of the waterit is not contoured from side to side, so baby slips and slouches diagonally in the tub, resting his head on one of the hinges.That said, we are using this tub again with the second child, but I think it will only be useful for a few weeks.  We are already placing it into the big tub and using it there, which erases any benefit to the parent of not having to bend over.If we had the space, I would definitely use a different tub.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I love this thing, all the advantages of a full size bath with a special twist.  I live in a very small house and this was perfect for my needs.  It folds easily, the baby fits in the bath tub as if it was any other bath.  I do not see any pinching hazards due to it being a folding tub.  Mat is easily cleaned as it is not to porous.  Would recommend, especially if you have limited space.",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"For new moms looking for a easy, compact tub..this is the one!I\'ve used this tub for my daughter since she was 2 weeks old.  As she got older I put this tub right in our larger tub and it fills and drains easy.  It\'s easy to clean, folds easy and you can store it right in the closet.  After each bath I would leave it out to dry and then folded it up and stored it away, it NEVER got mildew or smelled.  My daughter is now 7 months old and has out grown this tub but I have to say it\'s the best one yet!",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I have used this tub since I brought my newborn home fromthe hospital.  He loves getting a bath.  This tub keeps the water below his waist, for less chance of drowning as long as I am right there.  It also has a plug that I can let water out if neede, in case it is too full.  It has a rubber center that keeps baby from slipping and causing injury.  This tub folds up really nicely and I can fit it under my sink to keep it out of the way.  So, it is handy, safe, and convenient.",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,this tub it totally uncomfortable and poorly made.  safety first needs to get their act together because a lot of their products lately are poorly made!,1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This is the first review I have bothered to write because I feel so strongly on this item.I will be looking for another bather asap. I have used this one twice. The first time I didn\'t know the water would leak out the hinges on all 4 sides so I had water all over my countertop while my baby was just put in. It was difficult to try to catch the water and hold onto a screaming newborn. Plus I had to use her towel to sop up the water. Good thing Daddy was around to bring me another towel for her. The second time I used it I was aware that it leaked, but I still managed to have it overflow and water leak when the baby was put in. This leak factor would be ok if you were planning on putting the bather in the bathtub, but otherwise it makes a mess.Also, the water is so shallow that she shivered the entire time. If it is shallow when she is 3 weeks old, it will really be shallow when she is bigger. Don\'t recommend at all.",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I was given this tub, and am not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but it is terrible.  The plastic edges where the tub folds stick out and poke my little one in the temples when he slides sideways.  He is always slipping down lower, and lower as I attempt to bathe him. The whole process quickly becomes an ordeal.  I was a nanny all through college and never had these problems with the other tubs.  I really don\'t like it.",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I would highly recommend this tub to any new parent.  My daughter has been taking her baths in this since she was born (now six months) and only now will I begin to start her in the ""adult"" tub in a bathing seat.This tub is safe - padding helps to keep baby in place, of course you have to hold her 100% of the time! Isn\'t this common sense?This tub is easy to clean.  Rinse off and wipe it down -- I am done with clean up in minutes.This tub is convenient.  It folds up and stores under your sink, in a cabinet, wherever.  Out of sight!!!This tub is reasonably priced.  Because you will only use it for a short time (they\'ll outgrow it by six months) you don\'t have to spend a lot for its great features.I highly recommend it to all!!!",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I bought this tub about 6 years ago for my first child and am now using it for our newest addition and I have not experienced any problems. As far as the water going over the sides, which it does do that, I keep the water running in the tub and keep the bottom portion under the running water so the water around the baby is always warm. My children were and are small babies so outgrowing the tub early has not been a problem. My first daughter was sitting on her own by 2 1/2 months but she still loved sitting in this tub and playing. Though not perfect, but what is these days, I would still recommend it.",4
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"My mom got this tub for my daughter right after she was born.  We have used it since she was able to take a bath, and she\'s 4 months old.  I liked that it could be folded, but I never actually put it away unless we have company since I use it daily.  It does leak at the hinges.  My daughter is very comfortable in it.  Since she was born in the winter, I gave her a bath in the bathroom so that I could get it really warm.  It does fit in the kitchen sink though.  I still give her her bath in the bathroom, and just sit her tub in the big tub.  It uses less water, her head is elevated, and she\'s a little higher.  She hasn\'t outgrown it yet, and has plenty of room. It is a great tub, and a great price!",4
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"We bought this tub because the cloth one we had before got a musty smell to it if you didn\'t machiene wash it after every bath.  We liked the ease of cleaning this tub, and how it folds up to store nicely.  I didn\'t experience any problems with leaking, (only with splashing, as my daughter likes to waive her arms in the tub).  On the downside, my daughter is only 8 weeks old and 24 inches long.. her legs drape up and over the tub and her feet are FREEZING during bathtime eventhough we keep a heater blowing on us the whole time. As she has gotten stronger, she will bend her knees and get her legs inside the tub where she quickly pushes off the upslope and nealy catapolts herself from the tub.  She has more than once ended up hitting the hard plastic sides with her face when she turns her head to look around, despite the fact that I always have a hand on her.I guess, bottom line the tub is OK for the money and for small, lethargic babies with genetically warm feet.",3
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,I have been using this tub since my baby\'s first bath.  He is 5 months old now and we still use this tub all the time. This is very useful.  My son also like this tub very much.  He is very comfortable with this tub. The only problem I faced is that the water leaks in seams.  You should be careful about that.  Otherwise this tub is very comfortable.,4
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,Our baby boy seems to love this tub. It fits fine in our double sink and the baby seems quite comfortable.  I do wish it held a little more water but how much water does a 2 month old need! This is a great tub for the money.,4
Floating Bath Pal Baby Bath Thermometer,"I have purchased this item multiple times for all of my friends expecting a little one. The baby thermometer works wonders when a little one progress from using a baby bathtub to being alone in the big bath tub. I was always afraid of giving a little one a bath in hot water and I was always giving my little one a cold bath. With this thermometer, I never have to worry about the temperature of the bath water again. The kids love it as well. It is very durable and the kids love to play with it.The way it works is by dunking the thermometer in the water for a few seconds. As long as you see green numbers on the thermometer, the water is good. If the number is blue, it is either regressing or progressing and you need to adjust the temperature as needed. All of my friends love it.",5
Stroller Rain Cover,"I bought this rain shield after reading another review that said it fits Peg Perego strollers. Since we live in NYC, it is an absolute essential! We had a Prince Lionheart Rain Shield but left it behind on a trip.The quality of this shield is excellent; durable, heavy plastic, nice side vents, etc.The major flaw is that it does not hang down far enough in the front, and when we were out with it last, my 17 month old\'s feet were drenched because the shield left them exposed. He is of average height but since he will obviously grow before he is totally out of the stroller, this shield is useless to us. (I will save it for any future babies, when we are using the carseat/stroller combo).I am really disappointed and will have to buy another shield.",2
Stroller Rain Cover,I had this on my baby list as it claims it fits over most strollers. I too have the Peg Perego Pliko stroller and last week I tried using it for the first time. Hah! I spent 20 minutes in the wind trying to get the darn thing to stay put. There are no straps or snaps or anything to keep it over the stroller and it kept blowing off like an inflatable balloon! I spent more time chasing it across the parking lot than anything else. Gave up and will be returning it. When I was in the UK they sold a Peg Perego rain cover that first over the Pliko perfectly. Where can I get one here?? Don\'t waste your money if you have a Peg Perego!,1
Stroller Rain Cover,"Living in the city, our only form of entertainment outside is really to just take a stroll, and this cover really helps, especially on those sunny but windy days.  I do agree with others that it\'s a pain to fold up, but it is do-able.  You just have to keep the creases there (from when you first open the package), but folding it the same way (like a paper bag)...then it\'ll come out somewhat flat.It\'s also nice that it fits over the stroller even with the car seat snapped in.",4
Stroller Rain Cover,"My hubsand and I just moved to England on a military duty tour , and the weather is crazy. But the rain cover was great it fitted very good on the stroller , and it even fit on the baby jogger . Love it",5
Graco Traveling Potty Seat,"I was a little worried about pinching after reading reviews, but I ALSO read the reviews about how to use it and that helped so much. It works like a charm. I like having it because DD\'s little bum would just fall into the bowl w/o it. I bring it aling everywhere so we don\'t have to worry about if someone has a potty seat or not.",4
Graco Traveling Potty Seat,"We\'re currently in the process of potty training our 2 yr old daughter, and we travel a bit.  I saw this and thought it a great idea!  Only problem is, if the seat isn\'t EXACTLY on right, it can slide off of some hotel toilets.  Doesn\'t work to well on the extra large (oblong) toilets because the back part isn\'t supported by the normal toilet seat, but it does help.  And you do know its clean and you know where its been, so when lil one puts her hands on it to help support herself, you don\'t have to worry about what shes acutally picking up. Travels well in a diaper bag, purse, or the back of a stroller.",4
Graco Traveling Potty Seat,My sister gave me her\'s for my now 6-year-old daughter.  It was great!  I can\'t find it and am going to purchase a new one for my 2-year-old son who is now potty trained!!!!  I hate to rely on the paper seats for protection.  This is much better and YOU KNOW it\'s clean.,4
Graco Traveling Potty Seat,"This is a wonderful way for your boy or girl to stay clean and comfortable using the potty when away from home.  It is foldable which makes it easy to carry in a purse; it is comfortable and stable on the toilet which reinforces the child that it is safe to sit freely.  Don\'t be worried about catching your child\'s skin on the fold ends, it does not.  A convenient plastic zipper bag is sold with it too.  Enjoy!",5
Graco Traveling Potty Seat,"If your child is too little to slide all the way back or you can\'t stand the thought of them touching the a public restroom, then this \'might\' work. But, this thing fell in the stupid toilets more times than I care to remember and that is less sanitary. If I\'m going somewhere where it\'s easy for me to take the regular potty ring [not foldable] I do that. Otherwise, I use wipes and toilet paper and save myself the trouble.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was given this tub at my baby shower. At first it seemed to be a great gift because it would work until my daughter was a toddler. Well, it didn\'t turn out that way. The tub leaks water from the bottom even if you follow the directions on how to put it together. I didn\'t realize it was leaking until there was a huge puddle on my bathroom counter. Another drawback is that it is so big that I can\'t get it to drain into my bathroom sink if it is sitting on the counter...so I have to carry it over to the tub to drain. ANY time I have lifted it in order to drain it in the tub, when it was supposed to be locked together...it ALWAYS came apart and water poured out all over the bathroom floor. I had to mop this up three times before I finally decided to give it up and get a new tub.Another thing that was extremely annoying is that my daughter would slide down the net sling everytime which meant I had to constantly pick her up and readjust her...not easy with a wet slippery baby!I HATE THIS TUB!!! I just bought a new tub (FOR LESS MONEY) that is GREAT! It has a sling that goes all the way across the top of the tub so she doesn\'t slip at all. Now she likes bathtime..and so do I.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I have used this tub for two years, but that is only because I\'ve been too busy to figure out another solution.  This tub is meant to sit within the ""real"" bathtub, so be aware of that before you buy it.  Yes, it\'s likely to leak if you try to move it full of water, so it doesn\'t work well on a countertop or on the floor.  The sling-type thing for use with newborns I found to work well.  Likewise, the blue part for use with older babies that can sit up also worked well.  But my major issue with this tub is all the cracks and crevices that are impossible to clean.  Mildew thrives in them, and if you manage to take the tub apart once in awhile (a huge project), you will see disgusting gunk in the areas that don\'t get air.  I do still like the idea of bathing my now toddler in a smaller tub within the main tub (uses less water and easier to clean, in theory), so I will be looking for a seamless very plain tub to replace this one.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,Don\'t even think about buying this bath tub!!!! It leaks!!!Absolute junk!!!!,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,The 4-in 1 bath tub leaked on several occassions during set up and with baby inside it.  We could only use it in the shower because it leaked when placed on counter tops or table.  The bottom is sharp against babies back when laying inside it.  The suction cups on the bottom were difficult to work with.  I regret buying this product.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I have absolutly LOVED this tub!! We got it befor our first son was born, he is now 13 months and we still use it.  We are expecting our second child soon, and I have no intention of buying any other tub.  We had the same problem as many others, with the leaking, but once we made sure the tub was fully extended there were no other problems.  The sling worked beautifully until our son could sit on his own, and now we use the green bar.  I worked as a nanny for over 10 years befor I got pregnant and I have never seen a better tub!  I also have two slipped discs in my lower back...and now a HUGE belly, this product allows you to bath your child on a counter top or table top for and much longer time period than the others...this as allowed me to refrane from having to bend over during bath time, making this tub a life/back saver!!!  It was also wonderful because I could use this tub right away for sponge baths and still had no need to bend over which made post c-section healing much easier, and sponge baths less messy.  I HIGHLY recomend this product!!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I like this tub.  I have a premature daughter and I used the sling at first in the sink and gave her baths on it.  She is now 5 months and I have been using the tub and sling for a couple months when she got big enough for it.  She stays supported fine in the tub.  Her arms fall down where the sling isn\'t plush against the tub...that is the only problem I have with it.  She hasn\'t hurt herself though.  I think the tub is great.,4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I\'m shocked by all of the other reviews on this particular product.  Many complain that it\'s too small for their sink...hello!!!  It wasn\'t made for a SINK.  Anyway,...I love this tub.  I wouldn\'t want any other one.  It was the most convenient when my son needed to be on the sling =perfect=, and now that he\'s sitting up,... it\'s even more convenient.  Please ignore the negative reviews and I highly consider buying this product.  It may be the only tub you will buy in you child\' early stages.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I think this tub is great!  I got if for a shower gift about two years ago.  When my husband first put it together it leaked, but it hadn\'t been put together correctly.  My son is almost two and we are still using it, and we have had no problems.  I strongly recommend this product.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I haven\'t had problems with this tub.... I used another tub for my son for the first 3 months, and that tub became too small, so I purchased this one.  I\'m so glad I did.At 3 months, my son was large for his age, but unable to sit up yet, so this tub was perfect.I\'ve given it 4 stars instead of 5 because I agree with the other comments that it is not easily collapsible to store, and it is bulky, but we simply let it dry in the bathroom overnight and store it under his crib during the day - so space turned out to not be so much of a problem.I have had no issues with the tub leaking though.  Once it is completely extended, there is a good seal and it does not leak.I have and will continue to recommend this tub to all my friends.It\'s accomodating for longer than any tub out there.well worth the money.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,We received this tub as a shower gift. I was very pleased with it until I realized that it was leaking!  We wanted to return it purchase one of the many better made tubs out there but we threw away the box. I now give him baths in the kitchen sink. I would not recommend this product.,3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I thought this bathtub would be the perfect solution for our small house.  With only one bathroom and little storage space it looked like it would easily collapse and expand to fit in the cabinet.  Even though I am a fairly strong woman I found the buttons difficult to depress and the tabs on the bottom nearly impossible.  The tub will leak if the bottom tabs are not correctly pressed into place. Unless my husband is available to assemble and disassemble the bath I have to use it directly in the bathtub.  Hunching over the edge of the tub is uncomfortable to say the least.  When collapsed the bathtub is still a monster, taking up almost an entire cabinet in the bathroom.  However, this tub is better than a non-collapsible tub for tight living areas as it is possible, if difficult, to put it away out of site.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I bought this for a baby shower. The mother-to-be was enthusiastic about her gift.,4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I love this tub.  I think it was a great idea.  This works as a wonderful transition from a baby tub to the adult tub.  I bought it when my son was starting to sit, I didn\'t have to worry about a bath seats suctions not working and my son tipping over. Also I know it is hard to get older babies in and out of a regular bath seat without scraping knees. This bath seats clips on so I put him in the bathtub first, then just clip the seat on around him.  He can sit in the tub and play with his toys keeping everything within arms reach of him.  Its much better than filling an entire tub for such a little person.  It does leak a little, but I just put it in our tub so it doesn\'t matter.  This is a good idea anyway to get them used to the adult tub for when they do eventually have to use it.  I am not sure I would want it for a small infant.  I never used the sling/hammock thing.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub is really just not worth it.  Even if some people have had good experiences, look at how many haven\'t.  There are better tubs on the market -- affordable too.The sling is alright - we use it in the regular bathtub.The bathtub itself is awful - it leaks everywhere.  It would be nice if it didn\'t leak but it does.  I had seen the review on here where someone mentioned that maybe the tub wasn\'t snapped or locked in well -- this one was and it still leaked.Honestly - just look elsewhere - the headaches aren\'t worth it - looks like you have a 25% chance of getting the one tub that won\'t leak.  Ours is in the trash.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I think the 4-in-1 bathtub is the greatest. I originally put it on my registry because it looked good but I am happy to say it works wonderfully. I love the insert that allows the baby to lay back and still have easy access to wash his back. I also like the fact that it changes as your baby changes. The only drawback is that the place where you put the ring for the bath seat is a little difficult to clean, but cotton swabs work great. This is trully a must have for new moms.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this without reading the reviews.  The tub definately leaks a little bit, I suppose because they try to make it adjustable.  Because it leaked I bought a different tub.  In the end I went back to this one because it has the bath ring.  I feel much better knowing the baby isn\'t going to slip under the water. My daughter is 9 months now and she loves this tub.  What I did to resolve the leak issue was put a boot tray under it.  It fits perfectly and catches any water that gets by.  Great $5 fix for an otherwise terrific tub.  Hope this helps.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was really excited about this tub, thinking it would fullfil all of our needs- I was wrong! We tried using the tub sling in our sink when my son was about 4 weeks old. He would slide right off of it. It was more work having it in the sink than to just go without. Now as for the tub itself- I tried, my husband tried, as well as several other relatives, and if there is a way to use it without it leaking water....we couldn\'t figure it out!! Lastly, the amount of effort it took to pull the bath to full size, or to push it together for storage was more trouble than anyone would want to mess with. If you decide to give this tub a try, keep the box! We just ended up throwing ours away and buying a new tub.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub and am not impressed at all. Here are my top 3 complaints:1) Permanant thumb nail damage in putting the &$*$ thing together.2) Despite draining the tub, hanging it upside down and letting it dry, it still stays moist in spots and is a mold trap.3) Suction cups work VERY good and make for a real you know what to get the tub up.Probably the best part is the slanted infant mesh angle seat. That I use by it\'s self in our big tub. Don\'t waste your money.And one more thing, if you haven\'t broken all of your fingernails, this tub will leak until your husband snaps it like Hulk Hogan.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub is very hard to set up and I had to try a few times. The instructions given were lousy, I almost clipped my own fingers in between the moveable part while trying to slide it open fullsize.The base of this tub is also uneven, I\'m not sure if it\'s \'friendly\' to newborns as it could scratch the baby\'s skin. The fabric slide is also flimsy when set up at the edge of the tub, it moves!  This slide DOES NOT snap on as claimed, it simply just sits at the edge of the tub.. don\'t be fooled.Overall, I think if you have to use this tub, it may be better for a toddler since it has the bath ring.For newborns, this tub may not be suitable.  I\'m stuck with it and I don\'t even want to give it away as a gift because I don\'t think it\'s an ideal product.  I am thinking of getting another tub when my new baby arrives.Although the tub itself is \'Made in US\', the plastic quality is poor.  The slide is \'Made in China\' and the quality is acceptable.If you have a choice, don\'t buy this.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I quit using this tub after the first two months. Count me in the group who wishes they had read these reviews before buying...It leaked every time we used it - and we followed the instructions to the letter. I gave up and put the tub on a towel to soak up all the leaking water...It was also uncomfortable for our daughter if she wasn\'t in the sling. The design doesn\'t seem to be logical - all these tough plastic bits digging into the baby when they sit in the tub. We gave up and put it in the basement (where it\'s collecting dust) and bought a new tub.This tub is a waste of money. Don\'t bother with this product, there are much better options out there.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub was a big disappointment. It leaked the first time we used it. We ended up buying a simple one-piece tub. The two-piece design sounded like a good idea, but it was almost impossible to engage the locking tabs, and the gasket didn\'t hold up.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We got this tub as a gift before our baby was born.  We had put it on our registry and were thrilled to receive it.  The sling worked great in the kitchen sink for the 1st 3 weeks and then we moved to using the sling inside the baby tub in our bathtub which worked great for about a month.  Now we have scrapped the tub altogether and Mommy takes a bath with baby.  Our daughter is long for her age and by the time she was 4 months old she was banging her legs, feet and knees on the baby tub.  We tried moving onto the sitting position with the safety bar in front of her, but it was impossible to clean all of her in this position.  We never had trouble with leaks however as some have complained.  Overall, skip this and go with an inexpensive newborn sling for the first few weeks/months according to your baby\'s size and then opt for a non-skid bottomed bath (one of those foam thingies that baby can sit on without skidding around-they cost around $6) for baby to recline in if you don\'t want to bathe with your baby.  We find that if Mommy bathes with her, she gets all of her crooks and crevices much cleaner and has a blast also.  In a month or so she\'ll be stable enough to sit without slipping and won\'t need Mommy\'s support.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Terrible tub! We mistakenly used twice and it leaked both times...not from the center where it takes muscles to push it down to snap properly, but leaky on the sides...and then the suction cups stuck it to the counter and water went everywhere!!! I\'m going to still try to return it ASAP!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I liked the idea behind this product. It grows with the child which is neat. The sling is wonderful for newborns because you can use it in the tub or in the sink for really little ones. The only problem is that I don\'t really see how it will in fact grow with the child. My son is 3 months now and he\'s 24 inches. He\'s starting to fit awkwardly in the tub already. I guess it may work once he\'s old enough to sit up in the ring. The other problem I had with it is that it can\'t travel with you. It\'s way too bulky so you can only use it at home. It folds compactly at home but not enough to want to lug it around with you. Overall though, I really do like this tub. It\'s only $20 and you definitely get your money\'s worth.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My daughter weighed only 4lbs when she was born, so this tub with the sling option saved me.  She was to tiny to be in the sink for a bath and this tub was just what I needed.  She enjoyed every bath in the 4-in-1 tub, the sling was perfect, then she graduated to the ring to help her sit still, and then the tub by itself she enjoys so very much. Once this tub was open and all the locks snapped in place we just lifted up the suction cups and placed it against the side of the tub to dry for her next bath.  No leaks, no problems, EVER!!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We bought this bathtub with the thought in mind - it compacts down for easy storage.  I love the size of the tub, the built in tub ring and the sling that came with it was very helpful.  The price was very reasonable too.  The only thing I didn\'t care for is that it was not very easy to snap together and  fold it in.  We finally just left it extended.  Other than that, it is a great product.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I too had a really tough time expanding this tub and would not want to collapse &amp; extend this thing for every bath so it stays open. When open, it is too big to put in the sink and I don;t have much counter space. When carrying a full tub across the kitchen to the table, it leaks all over the floor. I have to pull the table over near the sink and use the sprayer to fill the tub. Terrible. Stick to the regular tubs that have been doing the job for years!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This was a fantastic tub for us.  We used the sling over the sink in the bathroom for the first two months (we put one end on the countertop and the other in the sink so it was mostly flat).  This was great for me to bathe my baby since I had a c-section and no desire to bend over the side of the tub.  After that, we used the sling in the baby tub in a real bathtub.  Why use it outside of one?  It is really easy to fill, empty and rinse out when in a real tub, plus it gets your child used to being in the big bathtub.  We just set the sling in the bottom of the tub and didn\'t prop it up like the photos show.  No slidey baby that way.  My daughter used it until she was almost 13 months old.  I\'d definitely buy it again.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"The Tub leaks from the bottom, sometimes in a gush and sometimes in a slow leak.  If left for an hour or so while going to put the baby to sleep, you will come back to find and empty tub and a very wet floor.By the second week the support sling had a funny odor from getting wet no matter how I cleaned it.  AND the suction cups stuck to my tub so hard they left marks!NOT A GOOD TUB AT ALL!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I too have a problem with the sling...actually, I have 2 problems.  The sling won\'t stay in place....it snaps in before we start the bath but starts sliding around.  My second problem is that the sling is slippery.  My son just slides down. One time he slid so quickly that his back hit the grooves that the toddler ring snap into and it left a bruise on his back! I have to place a washcloth over the area to keep him from getting bruised again. I still use this tub because I refuse to spend any more money on an item that is only used for a few months but I wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone else.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This is a good size tub, but it leaks when you move it. What bothers me the most is that, when it leaks, my poor baby starts to cry because she\'s cold! All of a sudden her warm bath turns into a nightmare. I have to crap her up and refill the tub again, now this is where it becomes FRUSTRATING... Bath time, in and of itself, is a lot of work, and to add a leaking tub, that just draws the line. Hope this helps!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received this bath as a shower gift (I had registered for it).  I used the tub for my daughter from the very beginning.  The sling was perfect to wash her for it let her lay back and not get water in her face when washing her hair.  I read in one review that the cloth on the sling got smelly.  Well, you have to take it off and wash it.  It does have that ability.  I used this tub until my daughter turned one.  I loved the tub and I still have it and will use it again if I have anymore children.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"All in all, I have been very satisfied with this tub.  While it has leaked a couple of times, the reason was that we put too much water in it--if you don\'t fill it too high, leakage is not a problem.  We have used it since our daughter was one week old, and the snap in sling feature made bathing so easy.  We keep it on the counter between our two bathroom sinks--it fits perfectly, and drains right into one of the sinks.  Our daughter is now a year old, but we still have the sling in it--it makes rinsing her off a snap.  We don\'t use the ring--it hasn\'t been necessary, she just sits up on the sling.  Now that she is trying to stand and twist and turn, I will probably move it into the bathtub, where I hope to get another year out of it. We do keep it open, and store it under the sink.  I agree that the snap feature is a bit difficult to use.  But I would buy it again.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My son (3.5 months) wiggles around so much I\'m afraid the sling is going to shoot right out from under him.  He pushes his heels into the bottom of the tub and pushes backwards.  This tub might be alright for an older baby, but if you have a wild one like mine, then you might want to pass.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This worked well when my daughter was smaller and had to lay on the sling. It did leak, I always had to place a towel under it.I changed it to the sitting position last night since she is now a good sitter. She ended up with bruises on her knees. The blue plastic piece is not soft so with her kicking scratched her and bruised her.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I bought it for my newborn and I hate it!!  Even after reading the instructions it worked ok for about a week and then it started to leak. Do yourself a favor and purchase different one.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,this tub is so annoying. i followed the instructions but the tub still leaked!!!,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Please do not buy this bath tub! As the other reviews have said, it is a leaky mess! Even with the tabs closed it still leaks! I have to put a few towels under it so that the counter doesn\'t flood! I am online now to find a new one. If you have received this as a gift, as we did, return it! Hopefully Safety First will read these reviews and take this product off the shelf!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub does not really take you through four stages.  I received it as a shower gift, and started using it right away.  The sling by itself was OK for stage one, but it doesn\'t fit comfortably or safely in the tub.  Once you have the tub open, it leaks!!!  Just don\'t waste your money; look elsewhere.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Don\'t waste your money buying this tub.  First of all, it was impossible locking the tabs in place.  I had to wait for my husband to come home to put it together, and even he had a difficult time with it.  So if you think that the collapsable feature is a good idea, you\'re wrong.  Secondly, when I filled the tub with water and picked it up, it leaked all over my floor.  I was so upset that I called Safety 1st.  They told me that the tub was not meant to be picked up and that the directions enclosed told me so.  I argued with them about this and demanded my money back.  It wasn\'t until that I demanded to speak to the manager that they told me they would refund my money only if I return the suction cups, the plug, and my receipt.  They said that they would send me a letter in the mail and after I receive the letter I needed to mail in the items.  It\'s been two weeks and I still haven\'t received this so-called letter.  I am never going to buy a Safety 1st item again because their customer service is terrible.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"For a first time mom, this was great,  for a newborn baby I would recommend using the slope in a sink that is  a better level for your back.  But for a few month old baby the slope in the bath is great, she was able to lie there and kick and splash and enjoy herself.The only set back that this has is that because it can be stored (one side fits into the other side) smaller it has two separate levels,  the thing with this is that the slope goes over the deeper part and you have to fill the tub up with more water to get to the higher end.  Which means that you have to use that much more water inorder to get a good depth.  In my opinion this feature would be better if the slope was over the higher end of the tub.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I have 3 boys.  Two of them are twins.  I received the bath for my 1st son\'s baby shower.  It is great.  When they were just infants up to 3 months old, I took the sling and put it in the sink.  After 3 months I put the sling into the bath, inside my bath, so I didn\'t have to worry about water spills.  When they were able to sit I took the sling out and adjusted the ring for them to sit.  When they were able to sit on their own I removed the ring.  As a bonus I was able to put my twins in there at the same time.  All the while I left the tub inside my big tub.  It helps to get them used to being in that area and to see the water come out of the faucet to fill up their tub.  The only thing I found was there was always a little water left in the tub after I drained it.  I would flip it over and leave it to dry.  I have no complaints about this tub what so ever.  My kids all loved it.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,This tub is ridiculous!  My son is barely 4 months old and he can\'t even fit in it lengthwise!  We can\'t adjust it to the sitting position though because he\'s not that great at balancing his upper torso.  So what gives?  We bought a tub that he\'s already outgrown (even though he\'s still a newborn) but can\'t use any of the other positions yet?  What a piece of crap.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We received this tub as a shower gift and started using it after our son\'s cord fell off. It worked GREAT for the first few months, but recently it has started to leak, and leak BAD! I fill it up with water, take my son\'s diaper off and get him to the bathroom, only to find that the tub is already almost empty. VERY disappointing.Also, the sling does NOT lock into place. It doesn\'t fit where it\'s supposed to. My son also slides down the sling all the time.My husband put the tub together and did it EXACTLY as it said to do, so the reviewer who said that it doesn\'t leak if you put it together right is wrong.We went out and bought a different tub today. Hopefully, we\'ll have better luck with the new one.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub sounds great on the box but not worth the effort.  LEAKS LEAKS LEAKS!!!  I received this tub as a shower gift and was truly excited.  When my daughter was able to be submerged I filled it up, left the room to undress her and came back to an empty tub.  To this day it will not hold water for more than 10 minutes. My bathtub fills with more water than this baby bath when I\'m trying to fill it for my daughter\'s tub. Buy the cheaper non-collapsable tub and forget about this one.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I originally bought the Euro bath as it was rated highly in the Baby bargains book.  However, once our baby was big enough to use it, she kept sliding down and it looked VERY uncomfortable.  I tried putting a towel under her and behind her back, but it was just very frustrating.  I then bought the tubside bath seat, but didn\'t like that either.  The seat sits well over an inch above the bottom of the tub, so you need to use quite a bit of water to get it up to her legs.  I know you aren\'t supposed to use a lot of water, by my little girl likes to kick her legs and splash.  So, I finally bought the 4 in 1 tub.  I wish I had gotten it from infancy.  It has a sling to use when the baby is really tiny, then when your baby can sit, the blue piece spins around so your baby is supported in a circle.  Our baby is almost 10 months and I am just about ready to turn the blue piece so she doesn\'t have it in front of her anymore.  Once she is too big for that, we can then move into the Euro bath and hopefully get a few years out of that.  Why use a ton of water when you can fill one of these tubs instead.  Plus I just feel more comfortable having our baby in more of a confined space.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I absolutely love this bathtub.  I used the sling when my daughter couldn\'t sit up and now she sits in the ring part of the tub.  It is a perfect size for an infant.  My daughter is 8 months old and I think she\'ll be able to use this tub for a few more months.,5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I bought this tub for my son before he was born and when i started using it i realized that it doesnt hold water.  I hoave to leave the tap on just to keep the tub filled.  Im glad that when I bathe my son I put this leaky tub into the bath tub.  I found that if you stuff a wash cloth in the bottom where the two pieces meet it hold in the water for the most part.  I wish I would have researched it more.  My husband and I thought it would be great so we could have our son grow into it.  Boy were we wrong!!!,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub as an exchange for a duplicate gift that I had received.  I have used it since birth, first on the kitchen counter and later inside the bath-tub.  The first time we opened it to use, it was confusing and very hard to push the secure tabs into place on the back to avoid leaking.  I never close it for storage since it is such a pain to open and close.  I liked the sling and never had a problem with it.  My biggest complaint is that it has so many corners and crevices that are impossible to keep clean. I think a better design would be to have more smooth surfaces to make it easier to clean, and forget the storage feature.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I found this one item to be an amazing value for the money.  The sling was helpful in the early weeks of my daughter\'s life for baths in the sink.  After she was old enough for baths in the tub we put this tub up on our kitchen counter for easy access - the sling worked great in the tub too.She used the bathring until about 18 months and then just the tub alone until recently. My daughter is 22 months and she just started taking baths in our bathtub instead of in this tub.  We never had any problems with it - and we loved the fact that it helped save water (important to us here in the SW) by not having to fill a big bathtub for just her.I would definitely recommend this product.,5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My husband and I thought that this tub looked great in the store, so we bought it thinking that we were going to be pleased, and our son would be able to use it for awhile.  When we got home, I checked the reviews on it, and got a little discouraged, but we decided to give it the benefit of the doubt.  It was great for about the 1st 1 1/2 months.  It then started to leak, and I NEVER unlocked it making it smaller, we just kept it fully locked all the time.  I would run the water for my sons bath, and by the time I was ready to put him in it, half the water was gone. Also I noticed that the infant bath sling was rusting where it connected to the tub. I immediatly retured it to the store, and got a different one.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub after my 2 1/2 month twin boys outgrew our sink.  I\'m very disappointed with it since it really doesn\'t hold much water and it tends to leak from the bottom once the water has been in there for a short while.  Also, since you can\'t fill it up all the way, my boys would always be getting cold and that would spoil the entire bath time experience.  I got so fed up with this product that I decided to just take them into the shower with me!  They love it and it\'s much more time effecient.  All in all, I wouldn\'t waste the $20.00 on this.  Spend a little more and maybe you can get something better.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"At first I carried the tub into the nursery to bathe my son and it worked great for a while, but the first time I tried to carry it to the bathroom (rather than my husband) to empty it out it leaked all over and I had a mess to clean. Since then I have used it in the bathtub (with a bad back this is difficult). My son is only 3 months old and already he is getting almost too long to use it (of course he is a rather large 3-month old). For the time being he is doing OK in it, he likes to splash around. I think when he get old enough to just lay down in it I will have to invest in a new tub. The sitting position might be good, but it will definitely need a non-skid seat (which I\'ll have to add on).",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,We had this tub set up on our counter top to give our son his first bath.  We read the directions carefully while assembling it.  About 10 min of washing my son I realized there was water all over my counter leaking out from the bottom.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it again being extra careful to do everything exact.  Same thing!!!!!  This Tub Is JUNK!,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"When my baby outgrew her newborn tub I shopped and looked at several baby tubs and I liked the ring on this tub.I do not have to hold the baby so she would not slide while been in the water. Also she would not be able to move too much or stand she is now 14 months old. I always wash my babys privates while she stands in the tub, then I sit her down. Let\'s face it the less they move around the less we work. It\'s difficult to open and close. Don\'t count on it. We also keep it open all the time and always make sure that it\'s locked on the bottom so it won\'t leak. This tub always leaks a little. It would of save us alot of time and water if they just made them one size.  But, after all.  I would not change it for any other. The ringis a time saver and keeps my baby in one place and is safe. Those other suction rings are not that safe.It\'s not that easy as they make it sound, but it\'s worth it.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,My husband and I both have problems getting this tub to latch!!  We live in a small apartment and thought that it would be convenient.  It takes up an entire shelf in our bathroom.  Our son is now old enough to sit up with the bar.  There\'s no tread on the bottom and our son continuously slides and can\'t sit up straight very well.  We\'ve started putting a handtowel underneath him to give him a little extra help.  It\'s riduculous...I would NOT recommend this product to other parents.  Spend the extra money and get something more useful!,2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Stay clear of this bathtub... I cleaned mine and in all of the crevises, MOLD had started top grow. The suction cups are so tight that if you fill up the tub and try to move it, you cannot lift it up. You have to take this tub apart every other day to keep it clean and safe for your child. My daughter also has a hard time laying on the mat. She keeps sliding down and I have to keep picking her back up. Buy a different bathtub for your child.........VERY DANGEROUS",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BATH. If you have bought the bath already look in the creases for bacteria that\'s growning. I didn\'t realize there was so much dirt and grim in my son\'s bath tub until I saw it floating one day and looked into all the cracks and was mortified.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I took this bathtub back. I registered for it b/c of the space saving feature, but found that it is actually big and bulky. It is hard to snap together... It just isn\'t a good buy.  You are better off with the cheaper ones without the pinchable, snap together nonsense.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I absolutly loved this bathtub!!!  It was a little hard to get the tub to lock for me but my husband did it in about 5 seconds!  I have three kids and three different tubs for each and this is by far the best yet!  It is very hard to bathe a newborn but with this tub it is soooo much easier!  I highly recomend this tub!,4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I received this item as a gift for my baby shower and just started to use it a week ago. When I filled the tub up it leaked water all over my kitchen floor. My husband finally pushed the lock thing down but it still leaked. This product is not something I urge people to purchase.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was really happy when I recieved this tub as a gift for my shower.  I thought the 4-1 was a great concept.  When my son was ready for his first bath I placed it on the kitchen counter filled with water, but by the time I actually got him to the tub it had leaked and all of the water was on the kitchen floor.  What was supposed to be an enjoyable time fom me and my son ended up being a disaster with a cold screaming baby and a huge mess to clean up.  From then on we put the tub inside of our bathtub which was really hard on my back since I had to lean over the tub.  It was really hard to snap open and shut so we left the huge tub open the entire time that my son used it which made the compacting feature useless and annoying since that was why the tub was leaking in the first place.  I gave the tub two stars because the suction cups kept the tub from slipping around, plus the tub did grow with my son as it said it was going to do.  This product has a great concept but needs to be improved.  I would recommend a simpler tub for anyone who is looking.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received this tub at my baby shower 13 months ago. I have had no problem at all with the tub, at first my daughter took her baths on the counter in the tub next to the sink, now at a year old she still takes them in this tub, but we put this little tub in our big tub! We never had any problem with leaks, and we always felt that she was safe in it. Especially when she was able to sit up by herself.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I registered for the tub and received it as a gift.  I was a little skeptical because of the bad reviews (but we needed something that would grow with our daughter since we do not have a tub - only a shower).I would recommend this tub to anyone.  It is easy to use and does NOT leak.  We have a small bathroom and it fits perfectly on the counter next to the sink.  The sling is at a perfect angle.  Our daughter loves bathtime.  We usually have to put a towel under the end of it because she splashes alot, but it has never leaked.It was relatively easy to put together - just make sure it clicks and you will have no problems.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I really like it even tho my son is only two weeks old and we really haven\'t had a chance to use this tub to its full potential yet.  My husband did want me to mention that the sling (as recommended for newborns) is WAY too big to fit into any sink.  No problem we kept it in the tub and attached the tub to the counter next to the sink.  Also my son keeps sliding down the sling.  Not only is there nothing to hold him in place, the sling is almost too slippery itself and he can end up in a heap at the bottom if one doesn\'t hang on tight enough.  Other than that, I really like it and have no complains as of yet.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I can not believe they still sell this piece of junk!!! I recieved this almost exact same thing at my shower over 3 years ago!!!!  I doesn\'t hold water at all! I had to fill the entire tub in order to use it as a &quot;tub seat&quot;on top of that,  my son found it to be the most uncomfortable seat ever when he was 7 months old-all he did was cry in it!! Do yourself a favor, don\'t ever think of buying this-even for your worst enemy, it\'s that bad.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I really recommend another product - anything would be better.I couldn\'t get the bath to clip togther properly, my husband couldn\'t either - so we gave up. We just pushed it together and the water leaked out. My baby was small and he was very uncomfortable in it and slipped around alot.The only bit I finally used was the sling over my knees when we were both in the bath - and its use was limited. This is too gimicky - try a good old fashioned tub.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I first tried the sling in the sink, and that was useless.  It just wouldn\'t stay in place and made the entire process way more difficult than it had to be.  I then tried the sling attached to the tub. This time it stayed put, however my daughter didn\'t.  It provided very little support and she was constantly sliding down, I would pull her back up and down she would slide down again.  By the end of the bath her entire backside was red.  I then purchased a new tub.  But now that she is sitting up, I am back to this one, using it with the ring.  I am much happier with it now, plenty of room for her to play without having to fill the big tub. I have no problems with it leaking.  I take it in and out of the big tub everyday and have yet to have any problems.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My little one is six months now and LOVES his bathtime. He giggles and splashes and feels very safe and comfortable in his little tub. I never used the sling in the sink. We went right into the little tub with the sling at first. We have never had any problems. I put his little tub in the normal, big tub and that works great. That way I can climb in the big tub, stay dry and be right by his side. I would definately recommend it to others.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I owned this tub with my first child and had to discard it when she grew out of it because it cracked. For my second child, I bought the First Years tub, which ended up being a total pain -- I threw it away and purchased this tub again.PROS -- I really like the sling for newborns. It can be used in this tub, as well as in your sink or large bathtub.  It\'s also easy to clean.-- The tummy rest is great once your child can sit up fairly well.  My babies both leaned their arms over the bar that goes across the middle and could enjoy splashing and playing with toys while I bathed them.  Having a good support like this makes it so much easier to keep a hold of them with one hand while grabbing shampoo, wash cloth, etc. with the other.-- It\'s great that the support can be removed for cleaning and for a last step tub before your child uses the big tub.CONS-- As other reviewers have said, it\'s a total pain to lock the center into place to keep it from leaking.  Once you\'ve done it the first time, it\'s OK, but I was fooled and thought it had snapped (it was the side locks making that noise!) and it leaked all over my counter.  I don\'t understand why it\'s not just manufactured at the full size without this expansion thing -- it\'s not like it\'s that much smaller when it\'s not locked into place.-- The suction cups are very strong, and it can be difficult to empty the tub when it\'s on your counter.  You have to sort of pop up the back ones and then one of the front ones and scoot it over your sink.  It\'s a little tricky, but you get used to it.-- Because the suction cups are so strong, our first tub eventually got a hole in the bottom where cup pulled the entire plastic around it from the base of the tub (hence the need to throw it away after the first child).I have only one comparison, which is the one-star First Years tub, and I\'d take this one over it any day.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This 4-in-1 Bath Station has been wonderful.  It\'s the perfect size for a newborn to toddler.  We have used the sling by itself by the sink for our daughter as a newborn.  We just used this method to sponge bath her and not worry about a newborn in a bath of water.  As she grew, we used the sling in the tub, then progressed with the various stages to help her sit up.  I never worried about her in the tub, though of course, I never left her alone either.  The tub grew with her through varies stages of development.  It was very helpful, and perfect to bathe her, no matter her age.  It is one of few items to use for a new child from the day she was brought home from the hospital to 3 years old!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"It leaks every time I use it. It\'s impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size.  I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it.  I love the sling, but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it.  If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside, it would probably be easier (but I don\'t think my knees would appreciate it.  I received this as a gift and didn\'t check the reviews before using, I should have.  I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk.  Buy at your own risk.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We bought this tub for our newborn daughter.I don\'t recommend it because:- It leaks- When you are not using the ring, but are using the cloth, the bottom part where the ring will snap leaves a mark on baby.- With time, that same part where the ring will snap, in the bottom of the tub, gets dirty (even though we wash the tub very well after each bath). I had a hard time cleaning that part because a Q-tip didn\'t fit well.- You save just a little of storage space when the tub is folded.Now the details:Unlike other reviewers, I found it very useful for a newborn because my daughter fitted in the cloth and she seemed very comfy.At first I though the other reviewers didn\'t install the tub properly, because I didn\'t had any leaks.If I had wrote a review at that point, I would have given it 5 stars.But when my daughter was 6 months old, the leaks started.And when I put the ring in place: surprise!! The part in the bottom where the ring was snaped was very dirty. And I wash the tub immediatly after the bath, while my husband gets the baby dressed!I found this tub usefull the first 6 months, but now that we have the Eurobath, we know what a good tub means. It has to be durable, comfortable for baby, easy to clean and useful from birth to toodler.This tub doesn\'t meet those standards.Now we have the Eurobath, from Primmo. It is the best tub ever, even for a newborn.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I love the bath station. It has made bath time a breeze!! It was a bit difficult to get the bath adjusted, to prevent the water leaking out, but after that it was smooth sailing. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a baby.I cant wait to transition as the baby grows.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I went through 3 bathtubs before finding this wonderful tub. It features 4 bathing options,4 suction tabs, and a drain plug. Most infant baths I came accross are chair shaped. I found that my daughter could not get fully immersed in the water and splash in these chair-shaped baths. The 4-in-1 Bath Station By Safety 1st is shaped like an ordinary basin and has 2 options for how the baby sits in it. It is deep enough for my daughter to experience floating and kicking sensations which she absolutely loves. As a tiny infant, I would lay her on the soft slope and hold her so that her body was mostly covered. She would kick her legs and let them float. Of course, you cannot take you hands off the baby while she is lying like this, but that\'s not a bad thing in that it keeps you right there and vigilant!Now that she is nearly 7 months old she sits up in the ring at the one end. The ring goes accross her middle and between her legs. This was absolutely magical for her. I cannot emphasize how much she loved it; leaning forward and reaching for her plastic bath toys and kicking her legs and arms up and down. She also learnt to hold onto the rail in front of her for balance. While you should never leave the room when bathing a baby; with the rail in this bath, you can take your hands off the baby and watch happily as she plays for as long as you will let her. She cannot fall backward or forward, and nor can she get her head under water.The bath also folds up. The two halves slide together so that it is half the size. I don\'t often do this though I can see that it would be useful! However because of the join in the middle of the bath, the two sides are different depths. This is no problem - only, I wish the deeper side were the side where the older baby sits in the ring, and the shallower side were the side you would put the slope for newborns. Not a big deal, just a suggestion!There is one downside is that once the bath is full, you cannot move it. If you do try to slide it forward or backward, all the water leaks out of it! So once it is filled, best to leave it where it is!I highly recommend this product which you can use for many many months right from birth. The best part of it is that its fun and this summer I\'m going to take it outside and use it as a splash pool that she can sit up by herself in!",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We got it for our son at my baby shower, and the first time we used u it, it was great, it was not hard to use, and it did not leak, my son loved it too.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,my kids love this bath tub.  its safe for them and convienant for me.,5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"After buying the first years 4 stage bath tub and hating it..I bought this one. Although I have not used the newborn stage yet, my daughter loves sitting up in this tub. In turn, she loves bath time. I like that she is secure sitting up because of the bath ring. My tub does not leak and I like that it elongates to fit my growing baby. I think this turned out to be a good buy..so far.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My mom bought this for us after she decided that the bath chair we already owned was not good enough.  This has been the best bathtub we could have ever wanted!  The newborn sling is nice, and lets baby have contact with the water without feeling overwhelmed.  Our baby didn\'t really like bath time until he could sit up by himself, and at that point this bath tub became a necessity.  Baby loves to explore the tub, and the secure bath ring helps keep him safely and securely in one place.  He is now almost 20 mos and we still use it with the bath ring in place because he likes it better that way, too!  I especially like it because I don\'t have to worry about him slipping under the water accidentally if I look away for a second to get his towel ready or something.  We had a problem with leaking at first, too, but once we read the instructions and pushed the bottom down securely, we haven\'t had a problem since.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,Because this tub expands there is a rubber strip to connect the two pieces once it is expanded.  The problem is after a while that stip will begin to ware out and not hold the bath water.  I do not recommend this one at all.  I am now having my second child and this is definetly not on my registery list.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I had previously registered for another tub, though had to begin my research all over after my 6 month baby girl got her legs caught in the last tub.  This is an incredible tub..no leaking, great suction &amp; no rough parts to scrape our little angel.  We started using this tub when she was 6 month old so the first &amp; second stage of the tub I can not comment on..howver stage three is a delight for mother &amp; daughter...She loves her baths.  We keep it in our tub &amp; it works like a dream.  I highly reccommend this tub for new parents!!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We found this tub was uncomfortable for our son. He always slid down the sling into the water and we had to constantly lift him back up into position. The sling is also hard and uncomfortable on their little bums. We went out and bought the Evenflo Comfort Tub and it is MUCH, MUCH better and cheaper too. The baby fits very snug and secure and bathtime has become a favorite with him since getting it. We say dump this tub and get the comfort tub designed to go right over your sink.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Not sure why this got bad reviews.  There is a slight issue with locking the tub in the expanded position, if you don\'t snap it in right, it will leak.  But once we figured that out we had no problems.  We used the product starting at about 8 weeks when our son outgrew the sink but was too tiny for the tub and we stuck this tub right on our countertop for months with no problem.  Now we use it in our regular tub and it saves us from having to waste a tubful of water for one tiny person to bathe.  Our son is now almost one and he still loves this tub, great value!",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I bought this tub before reading the reviews...I wish I read it before because it leaked from day 1.  The lock on the bottom is so hard to push down.  It is even hard to slide it together for storage.  My daughter pooped while taking a bath and the water leaked.  I dont recommend this for purchase.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub, after having to contact the same company about the older small blue ring model after the cups gave way for no apparent reason and my 7 month went over head first. I went to Toys r Us and bought this nice new one, thinking this contraption was going to be OK. Well listen up people, what a joke, it leaks out every time, since about use after 3 times or so, my Husband can\'t fix it, he messed with sliding it back and forth, locking it in, which is quite difficult. Pressing on the center area doesn\'t work either, it just runs like a siv! I was taking this back ASAP, when I found this site, cant believe the company is still selling these. Also for the record there are very few choices in tub brands for sale in any stores,they seem to be running the show here. If they could fix the leaky problem, I think this tub would be #1, but looks grim. I leave tub on floor in larger tub, I dont move it, as the cups grab rather strong and don\'t release too good.But it is comfortable for sitting for 9 month baby. No water No Bath, I fill 3 times when he is in due to water running out, to let him have some time to play. SAD in Michigan.....not many choices either. I was going to exchange item , for another not knowing everyone else is saying the same thing, but NOW I KNOW.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years. Well, first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub, because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface. Most tubs are non-slip, that\'s what the little bumps are for in your tub. This was fine though, I planned to use it on our kitchen counter. No matter how hard I pressed on the middle ""locking"" device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor. This tub is more trouble than it\'s worth!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received the 4 in 1 bath station as a baby shower gift. One of the reasons why I registered for this item is because you can make it compact so its easy for storage, I found it very hard to keep closing it so I now keep it open which defeated the purpose of easy storage. Another reason why I think this tub is terrible is because once your baby can sit up, you can have them sit with the bar around and between her legs, once you take her out of that position her thighs rub against the bottom of the bar and leaves red scrap marks. I would not recommend this tub to anyone.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"First let me say that the mesh sling was great until our on was old enough to roll-over.  We used it by itself in the bath.  But the tub is terrible.  The part that you push to collapse the tub is right on the baby\'s spine and he cannot get comfortable.  And the ring doesn\'t fit right, so my son slides forward and it smashes his crotch.  We just have him sitting up in the bath.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"... and I\'m one of them. It\'s not water-tight, the plastic thing that helps them sit upright is just in the way when you\'re trying to put a bigger baby in it- just a total joke. We ended up putting it in a bathtub full of water so our son had someplace to sit but it\'s a huge waste of money, water and effort! Don\'t buy a product when over half the people reviewing it hated it!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I thought I must be doing something wrong - the water would pour out the bottom.  The two separate plastic peices never really snapped together.  My husband tried it and so did my father - this product is JUNK!,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"The insert is the only thing I really used for my son. I received this as a babyshower gift and was thrilled cause I didnt even think how I was going to bathe my little one. But I only used the slanted insert, and the tub was so hard his little kicking feet pounded on it, sounded painful. It leaked, and wouldnt stay clamped shut... so we just used the insert sling. That was wonderful, but you could buy that for a lot less money by itself.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought 2 of these.  One for our house and one for Grandma\'s.  Mine was a total dud.  When it was put together, it leaked and the frame for the sling was bent funny that it wobbled.  My mother\'s went together just fine, never leaked and the frame snapped perfectly into place.  We even used her sling after my daughter outgrew the tub.  When she was sitting on her own but I felt more comfortable with her having some support, she sat on the end of the sling, and it worked perfect!  So if you get one that doesn\'t guite work right, exchange it cause the next one might work fine.  It was a great tub for the price.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I didnt realize just how many problems this bath actually had before I bough it. The water wont stay in the bath. I dont care what method you use its impossible to keep the water from leaking, or actually pouring , out. As far as it fitting in the sink I dont know what kind of sink it would fit in , but definately not mine. So basically its useless....",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I like this tub because my son cannot reach the end to push off.  The sling does not latch in place, which would help.  I do not fold it for storage because it\'s a pain to do.  I still like it because I don\'t have to use a sponge support with it.  My husband prefers to have my son sit in it without the toddler bar.  It\'s easier to wash him that way.  Now that my son is too big for the tub (he\'s 17 months old), we still use the \'sling\' for him to lay on to have his hair washed and rinsed.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We had this tub with our first daughter, loved it then and we love it now.We had let our daughter use it with her outside toys when she outgrew it, so we had to buy a new one with our new baby.We had a problem the first night with leaking-that was because it had been nearly 3 years since we had used this type of tub and we didnt bother to read the instructions. Once my husband read the instructions, we were fine.It grew with our daughter. We used the sling, to the holding bar, to the actual tub. My husband says its economical, because we didnt have to fill a regular tub, saving water and energy. He is the penny pincher in this family.I highly recommend this product. I have actually bought this as a shower gift for a couple of my friends.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I registered for this tub based on the versatility it supposedly offers, however, I found that this tub and bath sling do not work well for infants.  My baby kept slipping down on the sling and would have been lying down in the tub if I didn\'t keep my hand under her bottom the entire.  Also, I followed the directions exactly and made sure that everything was snapped into place (which is not an easy thing to do!) and the tub still leaked.  Not a huge amount, but who wants a tub that leaks?  I ended up purchasing the Summer Infant fold-up bath seat at Babies-R-Us which I highly recommend. It made bath time less stressful for both me and my baby. I plan to try and use this tub again once my baby can sit up and use the bath ring portion.  I\'m hoping this tub isn\'t a total waste.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I got this tub for my baby shower for my daughter.  I have to say its not at all a good tub for an newborn.  Its a pain to empty and fill.  The suction cups on the bottom are so hard to get off once they stick to something.  Its a big big pain.I do love the sling that came with it and will be using that part for our new baby due in just a few weeks.but the tub its self went to the trash about 3 months after my daughter was born 17 mo ago.Buy something else.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We began using this tub for our premie twins this week.  After being sponge-bathed in the hospital for a month, it was time for them to get their first real baths.  We pulled the tub out to the full position and snapped it into place, and did not realize there is also a spot on the floor of the tub that also needs to be snapped down.  We initially had a flood all over the bathroom counter.  After moving the tub into our bathroom tub, and snapping it into place, the leakage seemed under control.  However, we are not willing to attempt to try using it on the countertop again.  Because of the way this tub is made, in two pieces, it seems inevitable that there will be leaks.  We are currently trying to use the infant sling to help bathe our twins, however, the boys do slip and slide down the sling.  Maybe for babies that are a little bigger, the sling may work.  However, if you have premies, or just small newborns, the sling is pretty worthless.  It was almost easier to give our boys a sponge bath, without the tub at all.  I gave this tub 3 stars, because it will probably work much better when the boys grow a little more.  For now, there\'s got to be a better tub out there, especially for tiny babies.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was hoping to get great use out of this tub, however I had to return it.  It leaks through the seam, even when it was locked.  The store I took it back to, said  lots of people have this problem.  Don\'t waste your money.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was so thrilled that this would be the last tub I would have to buy.  My 11 month old loves sitting up in it, and now that I\'m expecting another baby in a few months the sling would come in handy.  The only problem is that all of a sudden it leaks tremendously.  We also never really closed it up because it was too hard to do but that would have been fine to deal with if it hadn\'t started to leak.  Now we have to rush her out of the tub before all the water leaks out.  And with the new baby on the way it looks like we are going to have to invest in another tub.  I don\'t reccommend buying this.  Especially since it started to leak after we had it more than 90 days so we couldn\'t even return it and get something else.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"It is one of those things when the tub looks better in the box.  For an infant the tub was way to big, my daughter kept sliding down.  For a toddler the water wouldn\'t stay in the tub unless it was extended out to its full length...Which right there was one of the reasons I bought the tub is becase it was supposed to be compact.  I would not recommend this tub to anyone, and I wish I would have bought a nicer one.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,This bathtub has to be one of the nicest and most useful ones on the market. It is slightly large but truely does work for various ages.,4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I bought this tub thinking that it would last me a long time and the price of it was reasonable. After two months the tub started leaking. At first we thoguht we did something wrong but after a while we discoverd the strip near the crease started to wear out causing the tub to leak. This pruchase was by far the worse $20.00 I ever spent...,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"The first time we went to put water in the tub for a real bath,  the thing just started pouring water out the bottom (from between the two connecting sections).  Don\'t waste your money!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I agree with everything jrcaesar said in the previous review, in fact he/she saved me quite a bit of typing. I have been using this tub for a week now, after using the Safety 1st Space Saver tub from 6 weeks til 8 1/2 months. What more can I say, I love it, my daughter loves it. We put it up on the kitchen counter and when we\'re done, we drag the end over the edge of the sink and pull the plug. No mess besides the water my daughter kicks all over the kitchen, and that\'s to be expected! P.S. The locking tabs get easier with time as long as you properly assemble the tub on a regular basis.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,My daughter is 7 months old and I\'ve used this tub since she was born. I really like it and it hasn\'t leaked on me. If you expand it correctly then you probably won\'t have leaks either. Collapsing and expanding it does take a couple of minutes but it\'s not impossible. I just leave mine expanded but I don\'t have other children so it\'s not in my way. At first I used it on the bathroom counter top and the suction cups on the bottom stuck great. So well in fact that I would really have to pull on them to get them off. But at least I knew it wasn\'t going to move. Now I use it in the regular bathtub because my daughter sits up and likes to splash. And it\'s big enough to have a bunch of toys in it with her. My daughter loves her baths and I like not having to fill up the regular bathtub with more water than I need. It also has plenty of room for growth so you\'ll probably be able to use it for awhile. I would definitely recommend this tub if you have the room for it.,4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub before reading reviews,and i regret it. the tub is actually 2 pieces that snap together, it is not easy to snap together. my baby is 6 months old. i tried to set him up in the little sitting tray, his little pee pee kept smushing up against the bar. not only that, but i wanted a tub that i can lay baby down in or recline. it is not easy to rinse a baby\'s hair when he is sitting straight up. but the way the sitting bar is positioned, if you try to rinse his hair, you cannot do it without getting water all over the place, because his back is against the edge of the bath tub.  but the thing i really dont like is that since the tub is in 2 pieces that snap together, there is a big hard plastic thing in the middle. you cannot lay baby down (without the sling, which is just for little babies) i even tried to put those little foam things in there but there is still this big lump where baby\'s back would be.  i will be returning this, i\'m sure wal-mart will not be happy with me",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Do not buy this tub!!!  What a hassle when it leaks all over the kitchen counter and the floor.  The leaking distracts you when you should be paying extra attention to the baby.  I read the directions and also had my husband and my mother try to fix the leaks, with no success.  Also the sling does not stay in the holes and pops out constantly.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"After using this bathtub every night for the past 27 months, I am about to order another one for baby #2.  I came across the online reviews and was very surprised to read about leaks.  Ours has never leaked.  I find it very easy to use, and I love its ability to adapt as your baby grows.  I do recall that it required some strength to assemble the first time, but putting it together was not nearly as difficult as many other baby products.  This tub is easy to fill up quickly so that you aren\'t spending excessive time drawing the bath rather than watching your child.  Its rounded plastic is comfortable for baby.  Plus, it doesn\'t lose water every time your child leans on it like the inflatable bath tubs do.  It is just the right size for a toddler and their bath toys.If you don\'t think you like this tub, give it a second chance.  It may work for you as a toddler tub stationed in your regular bathtub.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I got this tub as a shower gift that I didn\'t register for.  As a new sleep deprived mother, reading directions on how to get this piece of [...] tub to work was more than I could take.  Save yourself the frustration [...]",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"You don\'t need this extra hassle with bathing a little one.  Our tub has leaked from day one.  I\'ve even taken it apart and put it back together several times.  It\'s leaked when we bathe him in this tub inside our tub, on the counter, or wherever we put it (even with pushing down in the ""correct"" places to help the suction).  The sling also does pop out a lot.My husband is ready to throw it out he gets so frustrated with it.  By the time you fill up the tub and get the baby undressed, about an inch of water has leaked out.At four months, my son already stretches to the end of the tub and puts his feet over the edge.  He really likes to do it, but both my husband and I feel as though he\'s already outgrowing it.The tub is easy to clean.  The sling is very convenient.  My son loves his bathtime, but the little issues with the tub drive us crazy.  I\'d recommend seriously purchasing another tub - especially one that is all one piece so you don\'t have to worry about anything leaking out the seams.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I only used the tub a handful of times, but wore out the sling. When my daughter was old enough to sit on her own we bought a different tub seat. Plus, the tub doesn\'t fold up that much and still takes up much space.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received 2 tubs at my son\'s baby shower.  I returned the other and kept this one because it seemed like it had more features.  I wish I had kept the other because this one seems to leak every time I use it.  However, the infant sling thing is nice, and the tub itself is a good size.  I think I\'d rather get a tub that doesn\'t leak so much.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I got this tub at one of my showers....it leakes like crazy! I have not been satisfied with this tuba at all. When I registered for it I saw nothing but good reviews, but it is not worth the money. The sling does not help at all! I get the bath ready for my 6 month old son and then go and undress him...by the time i get back in the bath room all the water is almost gone! I have had to refill the tub at least three times now. I wish i had registered for a different tub.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,Absolutely disasterously designed product. Am taking it back to buybuybaby today. We tried to use it for the first time with our newborn. Instructions could not be more vague.Then there is an area in the middle of the bath that you have to push forward to lock. I did this and all that happened is the bath length extended. I tried many many times and had no luck in hearing a \'snap\' or seeing any evidence that it had locked. In the end we tried to fill it with water and it flooded our bathroom. I tried again to \'lock\' it and could not get it to work.It is a poorly designed and thought through product. The manual couldn\'t be more vague and less helpful to new parents.Just don\'t buy it and save yourself the clean up mess that we just went through.I hope this helps,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub worked okay when she was small. I did not have much problems with her slipping when she was on the level one. I just felt the tub was akward and big and difficult to store. It also was a little difficult to clean  w/ the small crevaces it has. It did leak if you did not push down on it hard enough. When my baby was old enough for the sitting position I really stopped liking the tub. It just seemed awkward and slippery. I just didn\'t feel secure with her sitting up it seemed slippery. So I just started bathing her in the kitchen sink ,this was still slippery but I felt more secure and I didn\'t have to deal with this tub that was hard to store and bulky. Around 8 months i just started bathing here in a small amount of water in the bath tub like a sml child and she loves this.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"When our 5 wk old is in the sling, he slides down and the middle snap-thing at the bottom of the tub digs into his bac, also leaving bruises. Very, very poor design.  Also, it doesn\'t even COME CLOSE to fittingin our single kitchen sink.  We refuse to use it anymore. We are gong out to ge the First Years Sure Comfort Deluxe Tub this weekend. It got 4.5 stars out of 5 on amazon and two couples we know swear b it. We should\'ve talked to them before we put this on our registry!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was not very happy with the 4 in one bath station, because it leaks.  It is made in a way where the water comes out from the bottom, since this tub is interchangeable to eventually be used for a toddler.  It is not sealed properly. I donot recommend this item.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I got this tub as a baby shower gift, although I did have problems with the locking tabs, once my husband figured it out, it worked great. We took the suction cups off the bottom of the tub because they did make emptying it a nightmare, even though it has a drain, not all the water empties out. The tub works great for little babies but once my son reached 25 inches, we had to quit using it because he could kick the middle of it where the bath seat is and it would hurt his feet, but we just put the bath sling in the regular bath tub and it works fine, he loves to splash around in the water. I plan on using the tub again once he can sit up on his own since it has the bath ring in it.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We registered for this tub and took it back the first time we used it. Yes, it does leak even when assembled correctly. The sling didn\'t fit into the tub quite right either. I wouldn\'t put my baby in it.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I thought this would be a great tub as we really needed a space-saving tub. It fit perfectly on the kitchen counter and it was easy to drain the water right into the sink. Well after a couple months I thought I was just careless and not fully extending the tub out to locking position (which the locking tabs are also hard to lock and release- you need pretty strong thumbs!), as several times I had water all over the counter and dripping down the cabinets. The problem with this tub is the rubber stripping which is at the seam between the two halves of this tub. It was completely twisted and coming off. There is not enough room to get your fingers in to fix it or replace it. As time went on the tub was leaking so bad I had to put it into the real bathtub in the bathroom. It eventually stopped holding water altogether. When I see people with this tub in their shopping carts, I immediately tell them about this tub and they can\'t put it back fast enough.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub despite of poor reviews because I figured that I could make sure that this tub didn\'t leak.  In terms of idea, it\'s great.  The sling was perfect for my newborn.  The idea of it shrinking was great too.  But the tub is extremely difficult to break down.  Also, it\'s really hard to get the tabs to go in to &quot;lock&quot; it so it doesn\'t leak.  I finally just left the tabs in place.  Well, within a few days, it leaked like a sieve.  The tabs were locked, everything was fine.  It just gives way and starts leaking.  Bad investment!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My husband and I really liked the design of this bathtub when we decided to ask for one in our shower list. After using it for only three months my daughter could not enjoy her bath anymore since this bathtub began leaking. We do not recommend this product to any parents. It sure is safe, but certainly cannot be used for too long when the water leaks away!",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I thought this would be a great item to buy for my second baby. However, it\'s too much trouble with the adjustments, it doesn\'t have a smooth bottom surface, and there isn\'t enough room (even for my 3 week old!).I would buy a regular, plain baby bathtub and an infant support.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"When we first started using this tub we thought it was great, but our son is now 5 months old and we hate it.  When we started placing it in the bathtub for baths because our son was splashing all around we had so many problems.  The suction cups would stick so hard to the tub that it was impossible to move it away from the faucet without spliing the whole thing or the bottem becoming unsnappped which caused leaks.  We removed the suction cups, but the tub still has a steady leak.  It\'s hard enough to bath a slippery baby - don\'t choose this tub that causes even more trouble.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,This station is so difficult to use. Bath sling doesnot fit properly in station.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I got this bathtub as a baby shower gift and it looked like a good one.  I did read the instructions begining to end.  The tub worked fine for about a month.  But then it started leaking bad all over the place.  Like a new mom doesn\'t have enough to do with out cleaning up a flood.  Anyways it just doesn\'t seal properly.  For awhile it would only leak when you picked up the baby and it didn\'t have that extra weight on it.  But now it leaks constiently.  So now I have to go buy one of the few things I didn\'t have to pay for in the first place.  This tub is the tub of my nightmares!  Don\'t waste your money and time buying this worthless piece of junk.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub when my twins were born and after setting it up for the first time AFTER following the directions, we had no problems with it.  The sling is very portable and was great for our many trips with the twins as infants.  As they got bigger I LOVED the bath ring feature.  And I felt like I was doing the enviroment a service as they approached 1 year when I wasn\'t filling the whole tub with water to bathe one tiny baby in.The suction cups work great as long as you don\'t have decals, etc on the floor of your tub.  There was no leaks, it was a great fit for the baby, no problems.I bought this tub again for my 3rd child and after setting it up following the directions again, it was leaking.  I called the company and told them I had a previously great experience with another one of this model tub without leaking.  They asked me about my set up and once they were assured it was done correctly,  they shipped me out a new one immediately.  They said that they did have a problem a while back with the seal leaking and this could have been one of the older tubs.  The new one works great and I love this tub all over again!!I highly recommend you get this tub...just set it up properly the first time.  You really have to press hard in the approprate spaces to seal it tightly!!!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I got this and returned it.  Not because it was horrible, just because my daughter is already 5 months old and too big for the sling and too small for the seat.  I ended getting the Eurobath instead.  The sling was slippery for her and I couldn\'t get it right.  The suction cups definitely do the job!  ...that\'s great if you don\'t want it to move, but in the tub it makes it more difficult for me to fill, empty, etc.  So, that turned out to be a negative for me.  Yeah, you can pry it up, but it\'s frustrating.  No leaking though!!  I tested it a few times and it was leak-proof for me.  So if you\'re only worried about that, then this is a good tub for you.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My daughter constantly slides down the sling.  Every minute or two, I am lifting her back up as she slides down into the water.  Unless you have it opened and locked absolutely perfectly, it leaks all over the place",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub sounded like a good idea when I registered for it, but I realized soon after that it was not what it seemed to be.  First of all, it leaked after a few months of use.  We thought it was due to it not being locked properly, but we relocked it and it did no good.  Secondly, it seems like you could use this tub for many stages of your baby\'s life, but you really can\'t use it for very long at all (at least not for us).  The tub only works in ONE position, you can\'t make it smaller like it looks. And by the time your baby gets old enough to move around he doesn\'t want to be confined to a seat anymore.  The one nice thing is the soft incline that you get with it, but the tub is so long, you have to really watch the baby and keep him/her from sliding forward and down under water. So, I really did not like this tub.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I got this tub as a baby shower gift and I\'ve been using it for 8 months now. This is a great tub to use however I also find this tub heavy and sometimes difficult to assemble.,3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I loved this tub! First of all though, I never took it apart. My kids have their own bathroom and we just left it set up! I loved the sling as I did the bath ring. I did try the free standing bath rings and found that 9 out of 10 times it did not stay attached to the tub. I am actually pregnant again and am buying the same one a second time b/c I got rid of my first one. I loved it!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We bought this tub after using one of the other baby tubs.  Our friend had this tub and said it was terrific.  I really didn\'t belive her.  However, after using it I love it!  My son is so happy when he gets his bath.  He is 4 months old and can kick his feet in it without a problem.  He can\'t sit up on his own yet so I still use the sling with a yellow teddy bear sponge to help support him from slipping.  I expanded the tub and it is a great size for my tall baby.  It drains really well also!  I don\'t have any problems with leaks.  You have to make sure that you latch the parts together properly so it doesn\'t leak.  It says that in the directions!  Overall I am very happy with this tub!",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This item is junk.  I originally chose it because it was a great concept, following the child through the stages.  I received it as a shower gift from my registry and once home I wanted to try it out.  When I expanded the tub, the center never snapped into place, so I could imagine that it would leak water out of it and perhaps could even pinch the baby\'s skin.  I tried everything to get it to snap but had no luck.  Then when I tried to collapse it I had such difficulty that by the time I was finished both of my hands were bright red from pushing and pulling and pressing the tabs.  The tabs on the sides were impossible to push down.  I thought this was a very poorly designed product and took it back immediately and purchased just a regular tub with an infant attachment.  Don\'t waste your money on this product, it is junk!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I purchased this tub because the toddler ring will not suction to the bottom of our tub.  This tub seemed to have great features, particularly the easy storage feature.  However, the underside of the inner ring has sharp edges, leaving my 6 month old with red marks across her chest and arms.  I have already returned it and was very disappointed.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"The sling is very secure - even in a round shaped sink, and provided me and my baby with a much more comfortable bath time session. My daughter - 5 weeks old- rested comfortably on the sling and enjoyed her bath. I pray it does not leak",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We had gotten this tub as a gift from the inlaws.  I did read the reviews at that time and most had been poor reviews, however we tried it anyway.  We love the tub!  Some of the reviews had complained that the tub leaked but as long as you follow the instructions there is no problem.  My son is now six months old and we have used this tub since he came home from the hospital.  The sling was wonderful and now he is old enough to sit up in the tub.  He just loves it.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I thought that this tub was great and got lots of use out of it.  I never had any problems with it leaking. I did use it both on the counter and in the tub, though I preferred to just put it in the regular bathtub because it was easier to fill up.  If you properly put it together and hear the ""snap"", it won\'t leak, and I like the suction cups on the bottom.  At first I thought that the sling would somehow snap in and I found it a little confusing, then I just draped it over the side and that worked for me and I suppose that\'s how it\'s meant to be used.  I have used the one piece tubs and I found them awkward and difficult to use.  I like how the sling in this one gave a little (not like those hard tubs with the cheap foam pads) and put him at a slight angle and more in the water.  I had a large baby (both in hieght and weight) and never had any size issues with this tub.  I eventually just bought the regular tub seat that hooks onto the side of the tub because although it\'s still big, it was easier to find a place to store it.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I orignally purchased this tub because it is a product of Safety 1st and because I thought it would be a great long-term bath for my baby since it has the ability to expand, collapse, and had a place for babies or toddlers to up in. Boy was I wrong.The first one I had began leaking a few weeks after I had been using it. We took it back for a replacement and a month or two later it starts leaking again, even worse than the first one leaked! I had to place towels underneath it before I filled it up with water and this morning  all the water just spewed out of the bottom soaking the entire towel and getting my bathroom counter all wet.I am taking it back today and finding a better tub. I wouldn\'t recommend this tub to anyone. If you look at the actual construction of the tub there is an evident hole beneath the tub between the two parts of plastic which has been rigged to absorb the water with a piece of sponge. Very ineffective product. I plan on writing to the manufacturer as well and encourage them to either stop selling this faulty product or revise the tub and stop the leaking.Hope this helps you.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Don\'t waste your money, even if you follow the directions, it still leaks.  I ignored the reviews and registered for it anyway because I thought that it was cute and practical.  In the beginning, we read the instructions and did not have any problems at all.  My son is 5 months old now, and by the time that we finish with his bath, he\'s sitting in an empty tub. Take heed!!!!  If not, you can\'t say that no one told you.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was given this tub as a gift and the tub does indeed leak like others have written, but the SLING is great!  We have been just using the bath sling in our tub since our baby was able to tub bathe and now our 4 month old still loves it!  It reclines just enough to keep his head out of the water and it doesn\'t take a lot of water to fill the tub.  It made bath time easy.  The bath sling needs to be sold seperately for that purpose.  No baby bathtub needed if you have this.  I didn\'t like other baby bathtubs because it seemed to be a hassle filling the tub and emptying it everytime you give a bath.  With this you can just fill the tub and drain it at the end of the bath.  Simple and easy.  Worth buying the tub to get the sling!",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I had such high hopes for this tub. It looks so neat on the outside of the box, but looks can deceive!! I am still using it, but I ""cuss"" at it every time for leaking all over!. I use it over my kitchen sink-as I have a spout that pulls out- and i have to surround the tub with towels so I do not get water all over everywhere. When you think about it\'s design, you realize what a stupid idea it is! A tub with a crack in the bottom! Destined to leak. If you want to make yourself clean your floors and countertops every time you bath baby -this is the tub for you - otherwise, save yourself the trouble and get something better!!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My baby girl is 8 months this month &amp; I have enjoyed it since her first bath! Since Macy was learning to sit on her own the ring has been there to prevent her from falling forward accidentally or when she reaches forward &amp; has been a great idea. The only thing is I think it could use some foam padding around the ring, though that plastic isn\'t harmful just would be more comfy I think. I would recommend it! I have to my sister expecting in April! Great Gift Idea! Good luck Brandi!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My baby is now 8 months old and we have decided to give up the hassle of using this bathtub.  First, it leaks through the division in the middle.  At the beginning it wasn\'t everyday but a few weeks ago we had to bathe our baby girl quickly so we wouldn\'t loose the water.  Second, the cloth in the bouncer-like baby holder is supposed to be mildew proof..Not!  I have even tried drying it by sunlight and it still smelled weird.  You have to wash it every couple of days.  Third, I would put the tub upside down resting on the bathtub and I would still find yellow mildew through the cracks and underneath the sitting attachment.  Fourth, the sitting attachment would not work for my baby girl.  It makes them sit too tightly and I couldn\'t reach her very well to bathe her.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I chose this product for my registry without reading any reviews. I immediately began using it with my newborn daughter and it worked great. I loved the idea of the plug because you can empty out all the water easily. The only bad part was that there were many cracks which were difficult to keep clean and dry which would cause to get moldy. I thought that was pretty disgusting. But I continued to keep using it until the bottom just all of a sudden cracked one day and I had to throw it out. Now I am pregnant again and am searching for a better tub for my baby.,3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received this as a shower gift and thought it was fabulous until I actually began to use it.  For the first couple of months I used the sling however, when my son began to get active, he would kick at the water so much that the sling wouldn\'t stay clipped in.  Once he was able to sit, I began to use the ring.  I discontinued use of it soon after because the ring actually cut his stomach when he leaned over the ring to grab his rubber ducky.  He is very chunky. A 20 lb, breastfed, 5 month old.  So I think that his stomach got pinched between his legs and the ring, and when he turned his body, it gave him a scratch.  I realized then that the underneath of the plastic ring is very rough and seems a bit sharp as well.  It also leaked the entire time, but wasn\'t too big a deal for me being that I used it in the tub anyway.  And I WAS locking it during each use.  Now that he is able to hold his head up, I just use my bath tub.  He seems to enjoy it more anyway.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I liked this tub.  My son also likes this tub.  He likes to lay on his sling or sit on the tup and splash water around.  He used to hate baths, but when we got this, he loved it.  It never leaked, but we do leave it on the extended position because it was a hassle opening it and closing it.  We give the baby a bath every night and clean it right after so we never had a problem with mold or anything.  The only thing is, when I fill it up with water and I put it on the sink, it\'s pretty heavy and the suctions work a little too good, so it\'s kind of complicated lifting it and trying to get the suctions to not suck and making the water not spill at the same time.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We followed the assembly instructions but since the first use, the water was leaking and the bath time was a hard time for me.There are so many bath tubs in the stores that are so much easy to handle than this.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,After using this tub for 11 weeks we found mildew had grown underneath the tub where the two pieces snap in place plus under the blue ring.  I immediately threw it away and went and bought a tub that does not snap together. I do not recommend it unless u plan to pull it apart after each use so it can dry properly.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received the bath station as a gift at my baby shower.  I had put it on my registry thinking it was great to have tub since I could use it until my son reached his toddler years.  At first I had to figure out how to assemble the tub which took me a little while to do, because it was so hard to pull together.  After I used the bath station it was fine for a couple of uses (about six times) then all of a sudden water started leaking from the tub from the sides now I have to go and buy a new one.  I recommend you do not buy this product.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This is the WORST bathtub EVER! It leaks where the seams are, and the sling is awful..does not support well. Also, where the seam of the tub is on the inside, there is a ridge that digs into baby\'s lower back, which doesn\'t seem too comfortable to me. The sling is too weak to hold baby up over this... even as a newborn (mine was only 6 lbs at birth!). You have to use at least one hand to hold baby up or to keep from slipping into the water (SAFETY HAZARD!!! HELLO!!!!!) So your hands aren\'t both free to clean baby. Just take my (and everyone else\'s it seems) advice and do not buy this or put it on your registry. I have, however, heard many good things about the eurobath. I think I\'m going to buy that one to replace this piece o\' bumpkiss.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,At first It was okay I\'ll admit that. Until I dedcided to use it more often I thought now I can give my baby a wonderful bath.  Well I followed the directions and set it up properly but the seal on it is terrible.  I had it leak on my countertops I had to shove towels under it before it could leak all over the place.  I Am supposed to get soaked from the baby splashing not the a leaky tub. I do use it in the tub now but I have to fill her tub every few minutes to keep it at a decent height.,1
Pack and Play Netting,"We love camping-- so this bug net was great for keeping over the pack and play while she slept, and also great for covering the stroller while out on walks in the woods. It\'s such a low price, absolutely worth it.",5
Pack and Play Netting,"I love it!  It definitely covers my playpen and the stroller very well!  There are no bugs that have been able to penetrate it.  The best part is that I can still see my little one, and she can see me, too!  It is very compactable when not in use.  VERY easy to use.",5
Pack and Play Netting,The Pack and Play Netting is a must have if you intend to ever have your Pack and Play outside.  The netting keeps the bugs out! It is very light weight so you can easily pack it in your diaper bag.  It also fits easily over the Graco Pack and Plays.,5
NoJo Secure Me Seat - Plaid,"This has adapted well to restaurant high chairs and carts.  The material is very attractive, and it wipes clean easily.  Worth the price IF you use it a lot (I often forget to use ours!).",4
NoJo Secure Me Seat - Plaid,I bought this seat when my son was five months and was still having a little problems with sitting up and the belt on this helped him sit up in the shopping carts and i didnt have to worry about him chewing on the shopping car bar. My only complant is what about the sides of the cart.,4
NoJo Secure Me Seat - Plaid,"I absolutely love this travel seat.  Everytime I go into a store, people ask me where I purchased this item.  It is a must have for any new parent.  However, I gave this item 4 stars rather than 5, because my son still finds a way to put his mouth and/or hands on the exposed parts of the shopping cart.  This is because the seat and handle cover do not cover the whole seat/handle (but it is better than having him sit directly on a dirty seat).  I would recommend this seat to any and every parent.",4
NoJo Secure Me Seat - Plaid,"My 8mo.old would not ride in a shopping cart, I found this item on a friends gift registry and bought it for myself.. Turned out to be the best money Ive spent in awhile.. My son rides without any problems now. Thank you thank you thank you......",5
"Snoozy Jersey Knit Crib Sheet Featuring Saftey Stay on Corners, Ecru, 28&quot; x 52&quot;","THis sheet is okay and gets the job done, but I was disappointed with how it was constructed.  There isn\'t any elastic on if and it looks as it it could have been sewn by me - kind of fits like a pillow case, but wit hthe opening down the back of it instead of at the head or foot of the mattress.  I feel like I could have bought the material and made it myself.  Maybe I\'ll do that in the future and use this as a guide for how to put one together.  All in all it works and washes fine, but not what I expected.  I wouldn\'t pay too much for it.",3
"Snoozy Jersey Knit Crib Sheet Featuring Saftey Stay on Corners, Ecru, 28&quot; x 52&quot;","I purchased this crib sheet because I have previouly owned jersey knit sheets for twin size beds and thought it would be nice for our newborn.  I thought it would feel more comfortable on her skin than basic crib sheets.  This particular sheet does not feel like other jersey knit sheets I have owned.  It does not feel soft at all.  (Jersey sheets are supposed to feel soft like an old t-shirt).  It is also really thin.  It does fit fine on the mattress, not too tight, not too loose.  I would not recommend this sheet.",2
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"My husband and I both can be in this (with the extension kit) with our twin 9 month olds. It\'s the only portable play area/ pen we\'ve found that\'s big enough for both kids, especially now that they\'re mobile. It\'s very stable, and has withstood my leaning on it, several attempts by the babies to move it, a babysitter, two cats and a clutzy uncle. The only potential drawback: unless you can step over the sides (which was an uncle problem), you\'ll need two free hands to open a passage for yourself.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Let me start off by saying I read almost all the reviews for this product (250 or so)before I decided to buy it. I was a bit skeptical, because I read many that said parts break off, and its really hard to fold and unfold, but so far I am extremely pleased with the superyard. (It\'s not difficult to position if you\'re strong enough to lift a baby up and down, up and down, a thousand times a day.)Like a few people have said, if you just use common sense this product is great.I have an extremely bouncy, lightning fast 8 month old, and even without the extension the superyard is big enough that he can move around without getting antsy, and strong enough for him to pull up on and cruise around.The only thing I can say that\'s negative about it is that it is big and clunky (its meant to give them more space than a pack and play type play yard)and it is fairly unattractive.For the price, it\'s a great find. Use some common sense, and it will serve you well.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"This is a great find for anyone with children two and under.First, this play yard is an all-purpose containment field for the little ones.  It is about twice as large as the average play yard, and can be configured several different ways to fit your area.  It goes indoors and out.  My kids have spent many an hour playing happily on our living room carpet without any childproofing necessary.Second, it is darn near indestructible.  Unlike conventional play yards with the soft padded sides and rippable netting, this is made of sturdy, thick polyurethane.  I have no doubt this thing will be around long after our second boy outgrows it.  It will probably outlast me.Third, it is much easier to setup or pack and fold than any other play yard that I\'ve ever tried.Finally, the super play yard is safer and more comfortable for our kids.  Because the bottom is whatever it happens to be set up on at the moment, you don\'t have to worry about sagging and collapsing.Fourth, you will find endless uses for it.  The super play yard is currently surrounding the Christmas tree and presents.  In the past I have also used it in place of a safety gate where the doorway was too wide otherwise.  No doubt we will use it to corral a new puppy someday.Although there will always be a place for the conventional padded playyards, we find ourselves using them much less often.  We may just get rid of them altogether.  The super play yard is definitely a keeper.-Andrea. aka Merribelle",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Superyard XT is an excellent product for child containment, providing exactly the protection a parent desires for outdoor play. It isn\'t a very large gate- even when fully extended, it covers an area only about the size of a medium to large playpen. But it offers enough space to keep one or two kids (and their toys) safely occupied.Superyard XT holds up well and I have left it outside during harsh weather conditions with no problems. It is very easy to clean and to transport. The panels fold together and the carrying strap makes the job even easier still. The panels do not fold completely flat- they do have some thickness, so don\'t expect this gate to fit into a tiny space. It needs at least enough space to accommodate the thickness when all six panels are folded together.The panels on Superyard XT are not very tall and because of this, the gate is good only for toddlers and other kids up to about two years of age. As children get older, they will be able to climb over the walls of the gate or possibly knock it down, making it impractical as a containment device. But the shorter height has one clear advantage: It makes it easy for parents because it can be stepped over. There is no need to dissemble the panels or open the gate to get inside.Superyard XT is solid and sturdy but consumers must be careful to position it properly. The gates cannot be placed in a straight line because the design of the gate diminishes its effectiveness when used in this manner. Each one of the joints has to be bent in order to become sturdy. Placed in a straight line, the gate cannot resist pressure and it will fall over with the slightest push.The only complaint I have with Superyard XT is the small space it covers. With the limited space, some people may have difficulty fitting even two kids inside the closed walls of the gate. Depending on the number of toys your kids have, one child might be all that will fit. This is why I strongly recommend purchasing an extension kit. This kit consists of two additional panels and while this doesn\'t sound like much, it increases the area substantially and it makes the gate capable of handling two kids with no problems.Overall, Superyard XT is a very good gate for child or pet containment. I brushed it off when I first saw it because it seemed like another useless product with limited use, marketed solely to take our hard earned money. But now that I own the Superyard, I cannot imagine life without this containment device. It offers kids a place to play where they are well- protected, giving parents some much needed peace of mind.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I must say that I tossed back and forth whether I should purchase this \'baby jail\' or not.  I was worried that I would be hindering my child\'s curiosity and I sort of felt bad.  I decided to go ahead and purchase this product anyway because I realized that I was not getting ANYTHING accomplished during my day (other than playing ... which is REALLY important too, don\'t get me wrong).  I\'m a stay at home mom and my baby is 14 months. She\'s toddling around and getting into everything.  It was hard for me to even quickly run to the bathroom before she bolted across the room for the computer wires, outlets, TV, etc...Anyway, my point is ... What on earth did I do without this \'fun zone\'?  This morning I was able to sit in the room with my daughter and sort dirty laundry without her picking it up and putting it in her mouth.  She LOVES this area.  I change up her toys on a daily basis so she doesn\'t get bored.  This structure is sturdy and with one added panel it\'s a nice big area.  When I was her age, my mom used a playpen.  It was much smaller and wasn\'t a good area to practice walking.BUY THIS PRODUCT ... Don\'t feel as though it is a \'baby jail\'; think of this as a safe \'fun zone\' that helps keep mommy sane.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I bought this Play yard at the Toy-R-US store becuase I felt that my 15th month old was getting too big for the pack-n-play and I needed ""something with space"" that she could be safe playing in while I cook,clean, or go to the bathroom for that matter! This has been a God send for me, becuase she\'s at that busy accident prone stage, and it gives me an extra hand when I need it! My pre-school age daycare kids like to play in it too, so I think I might purchase the attachment for it to make it bigger. The only downfall I had to it was the connector thing. It was kinda tricky to connect together, so I rate this Play Yard at 4 1/2 stars. Buy it! It will save you a lot of stress when you need an extra hand :o)",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,I love the play yard. My grandson is safe to play without worry of the bigger children or dog being able tp get to him.,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"This gate certainly comes in handy.  It\'s versatile and light-weight.  I like that you can remove sections to scale for different needs.  I think my favorite part is the height.  It\'s a little lower than most safety gates, making it easy to hop over.However, I always struggle when adjusting the position of the sections. My husband eventually broke one piece trying to fold it. It really resists popping into place at times. So I\'m not sure I could recommend it if you plan to open and close it often. It\'s best when set up and left alone.Having said that, we\'d be lost without it to keep our son away from the TV.  I\'d love to find an easier (and prettier) solution.",2
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I love this gate! It can stand alone or you can add the extentions to it to make it as large as you need. My son plays in this large gated area that has a very open feel to it - he does not feel confined to a small space like the pack n- play. Sometimes he\'s not even aware he has the boundries around him because he is so busy playing. I can put his favorite toys in the playyard and he is safe as he plays. He has his down time in the playyard too.  Sometimes my 4 year old gets in there with him and they play together.  The one thing you have to beware of is that when he wants to he can drag it to another area in the room.  It is a lightweight gate, however it has never tipped over.  This gate  has been such a sanity saver that I sent it to my friend who has 2 babies 19 months apart!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,This is a great product!  I use it to contain one of my dogs when we go out and then fold it up and put it in a closet in-between uses!  Love it!!,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I have 6 month old twins and just got this Superyard two weeks ago.  It\'s great. I had not seen anything else like it on the market for this price.  Since I have twins all other play yards just weren\'t going to be big enough, but this one is, especially with the extension kit, so they don\'t feel confined. I can even get in with them and play.  The Superyard XT keeps my babies from rolling or crawling away into danger.  I put a blanket on the floor and let the babies play.Just remember although its sturdy heavy molded plastic, it is still just plastic.  Use your common sense and it\'s a great safety tool.Note:  The yard must be set up so all hinges are at an angle, i.e. you can not set this up to make a rectangle and have it be safe, it must be in a shape such as a hexagon or octagon, so make sure your room is big enough.  We had to move out a chair to make room for it. . . well worth the move!  Also no more than one extension kit per Superyard; once it reaches the octagon shape, more extension kits make it unstable.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I wanted something that I could put my daughter in and she could crawl around safely.  The playpen was too small and she needed more room to explore.  I bought the extension kit immediately to make it seem even more bigger and she hardly even realizes it\'s an enclosure.  She has taught herself within a week how to stand up on her own and loves that she can still see everything that is going on around her.  I think it will be useful as she grows - even when we can use it to block off things such as the fireplace and Christmas tree...  It is easy to set up and can even fold up if you wanted to bring it to the beach, picnic, family gathering, etc.  It\'s made of a hard plastic that can easily be rinsed off.  I love it and am extremely happy with this play yard and more importantly my daughter is!!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"This is a good product and does indeed corral kids and pets as advertised.  The springs in the hinges, however, are very strong and make changing the angle of the corners quite a challenge at times.  We had such difficulty with one of the hinges we actually broke it trying to change it.  With a little practice, you can probably figure out the best method.  The ideal scenario for us was to set it up and leave it.  Once up and in place it works great.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"The Playgate came in a good size box that was easy to unpack. I unfolded the gate without any problems. The Playgate is a great weight and holds up very nice!! I use the play gate for my 2 puppies. They can see us and still play in safety when I can\'t watch them, its a great  playgate for my puppies, very sturdy and well worth every dime. The price was a good value!!!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I was a bit surprise to see how ugly this gate can be.  It takes up space and is just an ugly plastic gate.Three stars because it delivers well for what it\'s supposed to do.  However, the sheer size of it doesn\'t make it an attractive buy.We sold it back for $20 by putting it in one of our local newspaper\'s classified section.",3
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We bought 3 sets... family is buying them also.  Great idea for when you have to keep the little ones in a safe space, our twins love being and playing in it",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"This is a stay-at-home mom\'s lifesaver!As my little boy (now 9 months) has become moremobile, this product has helped tremendously.It has broadened his world but in an enclosed space.We keep his play yard in a corner within the superyard, in the children\'s playroom.He never gets tired of it. He can play with his toys,while I check my email, do the laundry and watch him at the same time. He loves it!He can crawl or cruise within his area and can see me whilehe plays. It\'s great that you can adjust the individual pieces.I recommend buying the extra parts to have a larger space for baby to roam in. It never hurts to have extra, in case one breaks. Great product! We have great fun playing in it together!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I bought this for my home and office, since my 10 month old grandson visits 2x a week.  It is wonderful, the only caution is that when you add additional extensions (we joined 1.5 superyards together)(and you will most likely need to, as it is not bigger enough without them) it is not as sturdy, so something to support it is necessary (put up against a wall or an ottoman on the outside to brace).  Also, the only criticism I have is that it is difficult to disconnect when entering or exiting the play area. Overall, however, I am very pleased with it.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I bought the Superyard when my daughter was 6 months old.  We had just bought a house and were remodeling and didn\'t want her to get into anything.  She was crawling already and didn\'t like being ""penned up"" in her little pack n\' play.  Besides the fact that she hated it, (She doesn\'t like to be confined to one area) it worked well.  Last Christmas, our daugher was 12 months old and wouldn\'t leave the Christmas tree alone so we pulled the Superyard out of storage and put it around the tree.  For that use alone it was worth it.  Like another review has said, Use common sense when using this product.  An adult falling on it will collapse it.  If your not tall enough to put the child in it safely by reaching over the top, open it up.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We got the superyard (or, as I call it, the &quot;Steel Cage Death Match&quot; yard) to contain our child in the living room and den while we are working. This is our experience. Your mileage may vary.Plus side: The fence itself is robust and basically indestructable. In it\'s four or five sided form, it\'s very stable, even against toddler rage! (&quot;Attica, Attica!&quot;) The sides can be taken apart, to make smaller areas.Minus side: the folding and locking mechanism is very stiff, and I was afraid I was breaking it at first when I was opening it up. So far it\'s not too much of a problem. The whole system is pretty heavy, and not nearly as portable as they try to tell you. Also, it\'s pretty clunky and large, so once it\'s up, we keep it up. The major downside is the price. Ack.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,This is a very small enclosure... I am saving to buy another one because at this point it is useless. I do think that once it\'s connected it\'s sturdy and I haven\'t had the issue of it collapsing like some posted. My son is 18 months and it contains him just fine and he does not try to climb it.,3
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,This provides an ideal safe play space for a crawling infant or toddler. Very sturdy. Easy to assemble. Would recommend.,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Everything else I have bought for my children needed all sorts of tools and such.. this needed nothing! It was already put together! How great is that! It has a lot of room inside it for my daughter (6 months), and my son who is 5! I think it is the best $ I have spent so far! My mother has the other type of play-yard and she does not like it at all. And because of how tall it is, I am sure she will not outgrow it as fast as she would have outgrown the other play-yard!I am so pleased with my purchase! I bet you will be also!!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I have one year old twins (a boy and a girl) and they are very active.  This has been a lifesaver.  We call it their ""corral"".  If I need to get a shower or cook or do anything that I can\'t keep a constant watch over the twins, I put them in the ""corral"".  We take it with us camping, to the beach, to Meme and Granddaddy\'s house and to family reunions.  We bought the extension set also so it would be big enough for two.  I can\'t rave about it enough.  We attach fun toys to the sides of it and the babies really like it.  In case you are wondering about older kids, it contains my very active two year old neice when she visits as well. This is something I couldn\'t live without.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"The Superyard XT is a wonderful product for babies who have outgrown their bouncers/swings, etc.  Once babies start to sit up and discover that they can crawl they don\'t want to be confined and this allows them to explore and play in a safe environment. It is rigid enough for the babies to play in and great for when they pull-up and ""cruise"" around.  I am astonished at the very few negative reviews of this product.  I have twin boys who are delighted every time we go into the Superyard.  It allows us all to play(one average sized adult and two 10 month old boys fit just fine with room to spare without extensions)safely.  I would recommend attaching link-a-doos to the gate as this gives them something to play with as well.  Run to the store DO NOT WALK for this product.  A definate must for mobile babies.  Enjoy!!!  Plus it gives mom and dad a few minutes to breathe.....Hope this review helps.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"very well made, fast set-up. if wanting to increase the size, don\'t bother with the extention kit, just get another one of these.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Bought it for my grandchildren, it worked great to keep them away from Christmas trees and villages. Can be used in two places when taken apart.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We got this set and extension kit and also 9 foam mats 2*2 feet at Toysrus and created very nice playard for our 7 moth old daughter. She plays in it along with her toys, has a lot of space and it\'s easy for me to clean.I\'m glad we have it.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,I actually use this to help raise my miniature pigs. It works great and the piglets can not escape out of it like they can with the metal ones. reoranch.com,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,I bought this gate to take apart and use it as a way to trap my puppy in the kitchen and off the furniture. It is easy to lift and move around. I also take it outside and use it for what is intended for--keeping the kids safe in the yard!! Great piece of equipement.,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"My son is 8 mos old and already is into everything!  I was afraid he would feel too confined, but with his favorite toys in reach he couldn\'t be happier!  It was very easy to set up and is not a total eyesore in our living room.  All in all, it was a great purchase!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"ease of assembly to larger kit, quick delivery - haven\'t yet placed in use as it is a gift for the grand children so i can\'t rate it higher",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,I bought this play yard for my grandson on Nov. 7.  It arrived with one section chipped.  It\'s also very large and leaves no room in our family room for people to walk.  It was on sale two weeks later at another location for $30 less.  I tried to return it but the company wanted a 25% restocking fee.  I would not recommend this play yard nor the company that sells it.,1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Gate looks like it would work great if you\'re thinking of using it as the ""superyard"" it\'s designed to be; however, for any of you who are simply looking to block off a thru-way larger than 8 feet -- like I was -- this gate will not work. It says right in the instructions not to use it in a ""straight"" position. The main problem is that there is no way to mount it to the wall. We tried to sturdy it by propping it between the partial walls on each side of the thru-way on one side and our couch on the other. This kept the gate upright, but it was very unsturdy so we decided to return it and look for something else.Unfortunately, the only other gate I\'ve found so far that is large enough to block our 9 foot space is the Keepsafe Expansion gate",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I think many of the positive reviews are coming from parents with calm, docile babies, or parents who have not used this play yard system more than 2 months.My son is only 8 months, but very mobile. He pulls to stand and regardless of the shape or orientation of the play yard he can easily tip it over. Square, hexagon, rectangle, he can flip it. Plus, it is VERY difficult to open. It\'s barely possible to open with just one person let alone one handed.  No one-handed option.  Today, I tried to reconfigure it into yet another shape to see if that would minimize flipping and CRACK, I broke off a piece of the connecting hinges. And yes, they are sharp. This product is poorly designed, and frankly a stupid item. It\'s a total waste of money.",1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,We use this as an outside/inside pen for our bunnies.  Personally for children or medium dogs I would buy three of them to connect together and make a play pen worth playing in. The one for our bunnies serves its purpose but I wouldn&#8217;t stick a kid or small dog in it for the space it offers is limited. On the other hand two of them would take up your living space quite a bit. Also if you have children it would be excellent as long as they can&#8217;t climb.,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Easy to put away and can make any shape out of it. Note- when folding it up, it makes a snap-sound to fold the gates together when putting away.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We use ours to cordon off the computer area in the living room.  This way, our son has free reign over all the safe areas of the room while we know the computer and bookshelves are safely fenced off.  It is an amazingly versatile product that I would highly recommend to any parent.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I have a 14 month old and one of her favorite things to do is play in her &quot;hexagon&quot; as we call it. I feel so confident having the yard to give my baby boundaries. She is not distracted with items in hour home that are off-limits, and yet she still has plenty of room to groove. She even took her first steps, with confidence, in the healthy boundaries of the Superyard. I really do not see it as a cage, and it saddens me to hear others criticize it as such. My daughter reads books, plays with dolls, and makes music and noise... all kinds of imaginative play... and all in this Superyard. I love to sneak up and watch her play without knowing I am there.The Superyard is like a room where everything is always baby proof, and ALWAYS CLEAN. It is VERY durable... I reposition it almost daily. I have taken it to the park for Barbeques, to the beach, and to friend\'s homes for use outdoors in the grass. I have a much more pleasant time with my daughter when we have this option, not to mention she is much less frustrated because I am not constantly telling her ""No"". I believe children must learn their boundaries, rather than putting everything up. I also realize that children vary just as adults do. If your child has the strength to move this Superyard, he/she is too mature for the product, however that does not make it unsafe for others. I conquer that it is not intended for use on surfaces such as hard wood, tile, and linoleum, without rubber reinforcements, but not at the fault of the product, just a result of two incompatible surfaces. This product has changed that way my baby plays on her own, and has changed my life. If you are considering purchasing this product, DO IT, and get the extra panel while you are at it. You will be thrilled with the freedom it allows you and your baby.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"the product was delivered as promised. i love the playyard but i think it could have been a little sturdier,depending on the energy of the child .",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,we got this as a shower gift for our twins...it is fine except that it came filthy in the box and it is very difficult to wipe down because of all the little indents and patterns in the plastic. it seems insane that a child\'s product would come so filthy straight out of the box.,1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"This was great for helping me keep an eye on my little one while I worked. I was working from home, and most days I was upstairs and on the computer. Once she could crawl, she started crawling toward everything dangerous. The litter box, the stairs, plugs, you name it, she found a way to get to it. I bought this and it was great! We even purchased the extension kit, so she basically had the whole room, yet was contained. My oldest son even liked to get in with her to play so she was never &quot;lonely&quot;.I also used this outdoors a lot during summer months. My family is big on campfires and cookouts and this was a great way to ensure her safety, yet not have her confined to a play pen!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I bought the same exact item from a pet store for 2x the price.  The company markets the item as the Petyard XT and it is the SAME EXACT ITEM!!!  Luckily my girlfriend, who has a baby, told me about the superyard.  I have linked my $100 petyard with my $50 superyard (they fit exactly) and my new puppy has a large safe play area.  I would definitely recommend this item to any puppy owner!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,My hubby noticed this product when we were at Babies&quot;R&quot;Us. I really wasnt crazy about it and tried to talk him out of buying it. I finally gave in and we even purchased the extention for it. I LOVE IT!! I cant believe I almost passed it up. My son is 19 months old now and he still enjoys it. He has yet to try to climb out of it. Once I put him in he sits and plays with his toys. Did I mention how HUGE it is. I can climb in and play with him. My hubby even climbs and is able to play with our son without a problem. You cant do that with other playpens.We have 2 dogs so this comes in handy when I dont want the puppies to disturb his playtime.We have a portable play pen and its just to small. we really didnt care for any other play pens we look at as they were not any bigger.I wanted my son to have enough room to walk and play without having to worry about him getting into something if the doorbell rang or phone rang.If your considering a playpen I certainly recommend this one. I\'d get the extention as well. Your child will really enjoy the the HUGE space to play in.I GIVE IT 5 STARS!! WORTH EVERY PENNY!,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I absolutely LOVE the Superyard!  It has many different uses, very versatile and we have used it inside and outside.  The fact that you can buy extension kits makes it even more useful.  We have a very active 17 month old who is content to play in the superyard with her toys, and I get in there with her to play.  She has lots of freedom to walk around and I don\'t have to chase her all day.I agree with the other reviews that of course you have to use common sense.  We have little trouble folding it up-and we have already added an extension kit to make it bigger.  It\'s great to take places--way better than lots of different gates all over the house!We will definitely use this one for our next one --and will probably be adding more extension kits to it!I don\'t mind the holes, and when kids have shoes on you don\'t have to worry about them putting their toes in the holes and trying to climb.  Just don\'t put big things in there that they can stand on and try to climb--again, common sense.I love it!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I just love the superyard gate system. It is so easy to set up and take down. I have no worries that this gate sysyem will provide the safety that I need for the 4 toddlers that i care for, when we are playing indoors or out. I also purchased the extension gate, and plan on peurchaseing another superyard and the extension to make a bigger area for when we really get outside. This product was the best investment that i have made. The cost was excellent and the delivery time was also great.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,Gate work very well. It takes some effort to separate the panels but that also means my child won\'t be able to do it.  It\'s designed to go in a hexagon shape for the most stability. I use it has a blocker for areas I don\'t want my child to access but if your not careful a small child could easily pull it over when using the product this way. Overall the gate performed better than I expected.,4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We have an older child and this gate helps to keep the baby away from the legos and other small toys.  It also helps in our house as there is no way to block off our kitchen with a regular baby gate.  We have used it outside as well.  We do not have a playpen so this has helped to &quot;contain&quot; the baby while we are in the front yard which has no fence.  It is a bit difficult to find a place to store it when it is not in use.  It keeps getting moved from room to room, but that\'s really the only problem we\'ve had with it so far.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"It\'s a lot bulkier than I expected.  I love the convenience of having my little one limited to a specific area, but it\'s a bit difficult to manuever about, as it\'s heavy and somewhat challenging to adjust the segments.  And it\'s BIG.  I guess I may appreciate this more when my 7 month old is into climbing and such, but right now I just struggle with how big and bulky it is.  A bit hard for me to just fold it up and move it back and forth from inside to outside, as the links fold not by a smooth fluid movement, but by hard-to-adjust ""clicks"".",3
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We have three toddlers, ages 4,3,and 14 months. We bought this for our living room and also outside for our 14 month old, as he refuses to stay in his tot block playpen! We bought this superyard yesterday and set it up in the living room. It was virtually impossible to get into the ""hexagon"" position. everytime we would adjust one angle, another would pop out of place. Once we finally got it in something vaguely resembling the picture on the box, we put our son in. All was well until he stood up. Even on the carpet he was able to push the whole yard around at will. When our 3 and 4 year olds joined him it was like demolition derby! They moved it all over the place, knocking over whichever sibling was not holding on to the same side!! It is currently collapsed and sitting on our porch! We will try it outside this evening, but based on the other reviews I have read, I don\'t expect that it will perform much better outdoors...",1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"This makes a nice safe play area for kids or pets.  It folds up easy and is very transportable.  Use it at the beach, camping, park or at home.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,I just got this item and already i\'n in love with it. I have peace of mind leaving my 8 month old in it while i run a load of clothes in the wash or something else. Its very sturdy and can with hold a lot. She likes having the freedom to crawl around and there is room for that and her toys. Its a great item and would sugguest this to anyone who has little ones.,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I have 10 month old twins and the Superyard is great because it keeps them in safe place where they can crawl and play. If the twins choose to go in different directions, their range is limited. It is even sturdy enough that they both stand and lean on the fencing and it does not tip over. They are confined to a set area and I don\'t have to worry about them getting into something I may have forgotten to baby proof in the house. Plus their toys are in one place in the room, not all over.This is great product if you want your child to have some independence and be safe.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I recieved this as a shower gift and began using it when my daughter began to crawl.  It was better than any play yard because there is much more room for toys and for baby.  As she grew (and the number of toys as well), I purchased an extension to make the area bigger.  It was great for both indoor and outdoor use.  We also used it to block the large open area between our kitchen and family room that no other gate would be large enough to cover.  Now that winter is here and she is running about, we are using it to block our wood(pellet) stove to prevent any accidents.  We also plan on using it around our Christmas tree again this year. Other reviews have complained that it is not sturdy or difficult to set up.  I have never had a problem and it folds up and stores easily.  Well worth it for it\'s versatility.",4
Supergate III,"We purchased this gate to mount between a wall & wrought iron railing at the top of a staircase.  We had a difficult time trying to find a gate that could be mounted in these conditions so we were excited to find this one.My husband installed the gate after having to purchase new screws because the ones that came with the gate were really short & stripped easy in the iron railing.Our gate isn\'t sturdy at all.  In fact, it seems pretty flimsy....and it is installed correctly.  I wouldn\'t trust it to hold the weight of my (17 lb) daughter if she were to stand up and lean on it.  We will keep it up until we can find a replacement.I think it would be ok if it wasn\'t mounted at the top of the stairs.  Someone had mentioned in a previous review that it was easy to climb and I can see how that would be the case.  The little holes are perfect little steps.Bottom line, I would not recommend this gate for the top of a stairway.  Just in a hallway...may be ok but I\'m sure you could find better.  Pretty disappointing.",2
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"If you buy the Superyard XT, buy this.  Without it, the yard is too small.  It\'s a GREAT, sturdy product, well worth the extra couple bucks!",5
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I can\'t say enough good things about this product.  I have a very open floor plan so it was impossible to block areas off for my toddler.  I always felt guilty when I had to clean or do anything that would take me away because he would cry from being confined to the play yard, but now he has space to roam in and I can go about my daily routine knowing that he is in a safe environment and is happy to have all that space.  I don\'t feel as though I am confining my child anymore, just keeping him safe. He has a large area to play in and I am able to get other things done and give my older child some undivided attention.  I have thought about buying another superyard XT and doubling his play area, but I will give this extention kit a shot first.  I can\'t wait until summer to take him out I have an umbrella and stand that I think will work great to keep him shaded but allow him time outdoors.  If there is a babys r us in your area buy it there it will save you quite a bit on shipping.",5
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"This product is not sturdy enough. It is good up to about 14 months and then after that it wasn\'t as useful. Concept is great, but not functional for me.",2
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I bought this in addition to the super play yard, and foam mat to make a large play area for my twins.  Love it.",5
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I used this extension on an already existing Superyard XT.  It takes a little extra strength to join together, but it locks in nice and extended the smaller ""pen"" to a nice size.",5
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I have never written a review before, but I felt compelled to do so now.  I have the superyard. It is awesome, I am here to buy the extension kit now.  My son is fast, into everything, and he would definately have been injured now without this thing.  It is great.  It keeps him safe, keeps me sane, and keeps the rest of the house safe too. I have a 30 gallon aquarium I need to get a new stand for because I am terrified he would pull the thing down.  With this I dont have to worry. He ruined our stereo speakers and I dont have to worry about that anymore.  We rent a very old house that is almost impossible to childproof properly, and it is so cluttered, I hate to put him in a cage, but since I have no choice, this is perfect. He has plenty of OPEN space, I don\'t feel so bad now. Play pens and play yards were useless, the child cannot learn to walk in those things. This way he is on the ground, living and learning to live like the rest of us, only he is safe. I reccommend it for everyone.  No one parent should be without it. It is much better than chasing your child all day and saying no, doorway gates cannot compare to this, he is just safe from everything.  One thing though. Kmart online has it ten dollars cheaper. The actual system that is. This two piece extension is cheaper here right now, and I have a gift certificate.  I can see where this would work for pups too.  It is a bit of a pain to put together though, but well worth it, so I dont complain!",5
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"My mother-in-law suggested we get my son a larger play pen so he can have more room to crawl and walk.  I thought this item would be too large in my home, but even though it is larger than the standard playpens, it\'s wonderful.  We just keep it over our area rug.  He can easily see through it, and the best part is.. the dog can\'t get him.  The other plus... when we go out... it can be easily moved over to our tiled floor area for the dog.  There is only one down side.  Your rug area needs to be well padded, if your child is just learning to stand, because if they fall and hit their head on the ground, it can hurt them.",4
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"After waiting an additional 3 weeks from the time I got the Superyard, I tried to fit the extension onto the Superyard as it was much needed. IT DIDN\'T WORK! I guess you are supposed to get 2 of the extensions, but I still don\'t see how they would fit. Neither myself or my husband could figure out how to connect the extension to the superyard; nothing we tried worked. (And yes, we read the directions) As soon as I can figure out how to return this thing, it\'s going back! It was a waste, as was the Superyard....",1
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I just had to review this great product!  We bought the superyard when my youngest son was 6 months old (he\'s now 2 1/2).  It worked GREAT with him but it has had much more use also!  I used it about a year ago for my two Golden Retrievers when they were puppies to keep them from destroying my house when inside and to contain them when outside since we live on 5 acres with no fence.  And now, I\'m using it for our latest animal addition, a 2 month old Dutch bunny -- it\'s great to use inside or outside with it also.  I\'m getting either the extension or another superyard to give him more room since he will be using it for a long time hopefully.  Just thought I\'d let everyone know how very useful this item is!!",5

Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,"I brought this as a gift for a friend\'s son because he loves the Thomas character. It seems to be a pretty nice purchase.

Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,"These dishes are pretty and fun for little Thomas fans, but if you have a ceramic tile floor, beware!  Cup broke on 1st use!  Pecoware did replace it for me, though, but I had to do a fair amount of e-mail exchanges before that happened.",3
Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,"Very nice 3 piece set.  Pictures on each piece are very detailed and nicer quality than most childs sets.  I would buy again but due to the high quality, I don\'t think I will need to.  It recommends washing on top rack of dishwasher.",5
Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,"It\'s Thomas - so isn\'t it obvious?  Good quality plastic dishes, and she always wants them - I should have bought 3 sets!",5
Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,I bought this set as a gift for my grandson and he was so excited when he opened it.  The next couple of days the only thing he wanted to have his food on was his Thomas the Train dinnerware.  Very durable.,5

Playskool Walk \'N Sounds Digger the Dog Children\'s Pull Toy,"My kids are all drawn to this toy and love the idea of ""walking"" the dog.  But it doesn\'t stay up when you pull it, so it drags on the side and is all scratched up.  Did playskool ever even try this out??? They get frustrated. It\'s in the trash pile, wouldn\'t want to even donate.",1
Playskool Walk \'N Sounds Digger the Dog Children\'s Pull Toy,"This dog is nothing like the original.  I had a digger the dog over 20 years ago and that is why I wanted this for my son. The one I had was big enough to pull over, through and around anything!  This one is so little and light it, plus the pull string is on the top/middle, so when it is pulled by a one year old it just topples over, even if he pulls it on a hard smooth surface.  The only enjoyment he gets out of it is by pulling the string to get it to make the noises.",2
Music Blocks Baby Maestro Opera Cartridge,"With city sounds, animal sounds, orchestra and vocal doing the ""La Donna e Mobile"" who would think that a 2-year old would prefer the man\'s singing?  Indeed, she also enjoys the chuckle immensely, but when I put the entire song on the stereo for her, she was thrilled.  She still asks frequently for the ""man singing"" -- over her Sesame street songs and other children\'s music.  We love this toy and this is probably the cartridge we use the most, with Jazz being our second favorite.",5
Music Blocks Baby Maestro Opera Cartridge,This one keeps cracking us up. My two year old mimics some of the song (the chuckle part). This one is my personal favorite so far.,5
Ship Ahoy Sorter,"I purchased this toy for my 14 month old son. He started to play with it before I had even taken it out of the box. Now it is the first toy that he goes to in the morning when he gets up. His favorite shape is the circle, because he can put it in by himself. The door on the front does pull off very easily, I yanked it off by accident when we were first playing with the toy, but I have since taken it off for good because it is easier for my son to get the shapes back out. This is a good &quot;busy&quot; toy.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I love this toy and so does my baby. I was worried at first, there didn\'t seem to be much interest, but now older, baby loves it!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I was looking for a ~$20 gift for a co-workers kid\'s first birthday and this looked highly rated.I gave it to the co-worker on a Friday to take to the party on Saturday and told him to let me know how it goes.  On Monday he said his son enjoyed it so far and the noises aren\'t super annoying or repetitive so it shouldn\'t drive him crazy any time soon.This seems like a very safe gift to give someone if you aren\'t sure what they are interested in.Recommended.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I got it based on reviews and I am glad I did.  My now-7-month-old son likes it though not as much as another musical toy.  The only downside of this toy as far as I can see - which was also pointed out by other reviewers - is that sound is very unnatural - I was surprised even though I was expecting it.  Think of an old cell phone with musical ringer.,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,lights up and teaches music fundamentals at an early age. It\'s not too annoying like some other sound gadgets are.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is a great musical toy for all ages! Our granddaughter loves hers.She  received hers at birth and continues to use this at 2 years. I recommend this to all babies and toddlers!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This was a Christmas present for my 9 month old. 8 months later it stays tucked in the toybox never to be played with. Maybe this would be better for a really young baby? He plays with it for about 5 seconds then gets bored. My 3 year old was never interested in it. The music is pleasant, and it is durable.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this for my 2 year old and was hesitant that it might be too young for her, but she loves music and she loves this cube!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"my son, who is now almost 18 mos. old, loves his mozart cube. he has played with this toy since christmas when we got it for him. most days he\'ll play in the living room and he\'ll play his mozart cube then go on to explore other toys...when the music stops he comes back to his cube to play it again! we\'re hoping that musical influences like this cube will encourage him to want to learn music.this cube is well constructed and lights up when the instrument blocks are playing. we liked the mozart cube enough to buy one for my sister and our best friend who are both pregnant!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"While this is a noise-making toy, it is a pleasure to hear. I play with it almost as much as my children. It is a lot of fun to hear the different pieces, and to hear how the different instruments blend in or are removed at the touch of a button. It is sturdy and holds up very well to the abuses of a toddler.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Both of my twins LOVE this toy! I really like how you can add/subtract the different instruments as the song plays. I did find it interesting that they enjoy one of the songs more than others and will keep pressing the orchestra button until they find the song the like. I think it\'s a good way to start to introduce them to music.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I gave this to my 1 year old grandson at Christmas.  He spent more time with this than anything else.  He was fasinated by the various sounds and combinations of sounds---even his older siblings (ages 2-4) wanted to play with it.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This was given to my two year old nephew as a birthday gift.  At first it would not work.  After determining it was not the batteries a little detective work found that the battery casing was not made correctly.  If it was screwed in to tight it would not work.  So this musical cube now works and itself is a great item, the music and intruments heard.  But if you touch the battery compartment it stops working and how do you tell a two year old not to handle the cube.  A+ for the item and c- for the toys construction.",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This was given to my son, as a gift, when he turned 1.  He is now 17 months old and it has been his favorite.  At first, he carried it everywhere around the house, hardly ever put it down.  Now he runs off and plays, but goes back to press the buttons so he can hear the music as he plays.  He even sleeps with it everynight and it is what finally gets him off to la-la land!  I would highly recommend this.  My husband is a musician and thinks it is the greatest also!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My baby loves music and lights and this toy is a perfect combination.  This keeps my baby entertained with music for quite some time.  He loves that he can move the cube in his hands without any help from Mom.  The buttons to activate the music and light are also easy to push.  He will stare, fascinated at the lights and sound.  If you want your child to appreciate music, this is a fantasic toy.  This is my favorite toy for my son and I find it to be priceless.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I liked this for my 6 month old son because it plays music and lights up. You can also press a couple of the buttons together or seperate and it plays together. It\'s neat and my son enjoys it.,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This toy seemed very well liked and is recommended on many toy homepages in the Top Ten Toys. I had high hopes but my little boy just doesn\'t seem interested. We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat. He is now almost 14 months and doesn\'t really play with it unless he is prompted by  me. Even then he\'ll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it. This thing is heavy for a little person and I\'m afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors. I thought it might just take him a little while and that he would be interested as he grows older but so far we could have done without it.,2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This toy is our son\'s favorite! I like the different musical options it has, and the very nicely rounded corners. It lights up but not in a super-fast, annoying way that so many baby toys do. It\'s very solid (has been dropped on the floor many times) and an overall quality toy. Two thumbs way up!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We\'re on our second one -- the first didn\'t work out of the box (which would have been a letdown for a child older than our toddler son). The replacement worked fine and has generally been a source of delight for our family (dad loves playing it, too!). For mom and dad, though, this toy has become a disappointment. The manufacturer has tried really hard to make this a tough toy and we salute them for that.  But after little more than a year, one button has died and the toy has a tendency to decide it ""doesn\'t feel like playing today"" even with brand-new batteries. Yes, toys wear out. But for the steep price, we expected much more.  In short: A great musical / educational toy, but not built to last.  Not a great value.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"The Mozart Magic Cube was given to my infant daughter as a Christmas gift--she loves it! Perfect for little hands as they are learning coordination and motor skills.  It is fun to listen to the songs and isolate the different instruments or add them back in, one by one.  The rubber sides are durable, especially if dropped.  Nice, also, to have no sharp edges on it, so it is very safe.  My 11 month old niece was over to play and she discovered the cube and was enchanted by it.  I will be giving her one for her very own for her upcoming birthday!  As for the loudness level, I  don\'t find it terribly loud; however, I recognize it needs to be at a certain level in order for babies to focus in on it (if it were softer, they might not pay attention to it).",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this Mozart magic cube last Christmas for my son.  He is now 14 months old, and he has loved this thing since he was about six months old.  I just bought one for another baby in my family... she is eight months old.  My son loves to smack the buttons to make the cube play different songs, and he\'s always quite intrigued when he hits one of the instrument buttons that makes, for instance, the drum sound go away or the piano sound rejoin the song.  It\'s a hit at my house!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this for my 4-month old son. He is very fussy baby but when I played the music on this cube, he loved it. The best sounds he liked were the flute, piano and the Orchestra. The Best thing about this Music cube is that you can play one instrument at a time and then the final orchestra one to kind of show the music-mix.I believe it will help develop my baby\'s musical skills.Cons: The battery didn\'t last long. We used it for 30 days, for about 10 min each day and the battery died down!",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 4-month-old loves her music cube!  The musical instrument sounds, while not EXACTLY right, sound very close to the actual instruments.  I was expecting to have an electronic, slightly robotic sound, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The colors and lights are very engaging, and even my two-year-old will pick this one up to play with it!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We bought this last year for Christmas for our (then) 18-month-old. She loved it, but the real surprise was last month when our 10-month-old discovered it. To say he loved it would be a real understatement!! He loves to crawl around after it and will play with it for 30 minutes at a time--amazing for a baby to play with something for that long.The music is a pleasure to listen to, especially compared with most musical baby toys. Like the other reviewers, I would have liked the addition of a volume control, but otherwise this toy is perfect. The batteries even seem to last a very long time. I was amazed that my 2-1/2 year old and 10-month-old can be mesmerized by the same toy.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Our grand daughter is 5 and a half months old. She absolutely LOVES this musical toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She pushes the center of each square with her fingers and toes...adorable. Each side plays a different instrument! I highly recommend this toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Toy is nice sound and sturdy. One yr old has learned to differentiate which sound he wants within two weeks. Great!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This has been a favorite toy of my daughter, now 2.5, since she got it as a baby.  The music is engaging and soothing to her, and wonderfully not annoying to the grown-ups (like so many music toys can be).",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"my granddaughter loves this, seems to really understand the different functions of the different buttons. the sounds are different from each button and are pleasing alone or in combination with other buttons.  i gave this to her when she was six months old, and she is now quite proficient with all the buttons at age eight months.  the sound is not annoying, either, as some of the sounds of toys are.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Our 11 month old daughter has LOVED this musical toy since the day we brought it home four months ago. She entertains herself and us by pressing the various instrument panels. She also enjoys watching the lights. The only drawback I can see is that it needs a volume switch.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My 18 mos. old granddaughter just loved it & figured it out immediately! She carries it around & dances to the music.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This toys plays beautiful classical music.  The child can choose which instruments to have playing or can use the entire orchestra.  It is pretty entertaining for the adults also :)  Much nicer also than many noisy toys.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"our cub adores this little music maker...it is extremely easy for him to operate and very well made (has survived many, many episodes of the babe flinging it from his crib)....the colors are interesting yet muted and the music pieces are lively but also lovely....very nice toy for baby and toddler....",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Purchased this because my 16 month old son loves music and this product has amazing reviews. Gave it to my son for Christmas and he is completely uninterested in it. . . I am disappointed,2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I am pretty sure I love it more than the baby! So much fun and at a great price on here. Baby laughs as I play!!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I\'m really not sure why so many people writing the review for this product are a.) being incredibly elitist about it vs. the older product by Embryonics that no longer exists and b.) complaining about the sound quality.Perhaps some of these parents expected the toy to be extremely loud and obnoxious like some Tickle Me Elmo doll, but I personally don\'t have a problem with the sound quality. Since it is made for close contact/play, it makes sense that this product wouldn\'t be so loud that I could hear it a mile away. And to be honest, the sound quality really isn\'t bad at all for what it is.This toy is very colorful and my son (who is only just turning 4 months old), while not really interested in toys yet, holds a fascination for listening to this thing make its noises. If I put it at his feet, he will kick it just to make it turn on. He really seems to enjoy it, even if he doesn\'t have quite enough strength yet to really push the buttons on his own. The construction seems pretty solid (I would almost be afraid that my kid could brain himself with this item if he were strong enough to pick it up) and it came included with batteries already installed.Children have the option of pushing one side of the cube to listen to it or adding in the sounds from other sides to create a cacophony of sound. There is also, of course, the orchestra button. If you push the button twice, it turns that particular instrument off so you can hear the other instruments. It lights up but I kind of wish it lit up more as you can barely see it in well-lit rooms.About the only complaint I really have is that some of the instruments don\'t sound anything like what the represented instrument should sound like. The violin for example sounds suspiciously like an oboe and the piano sounds remarkably like a harpsichord. However, I am not so elitist that I wouldn\'t let my kid play with this because the sounds are different than what I would expect them to be. I realize that most people cannot discern the differences in the sounds of like instruments in most cases unless they have had a background in music education, so it\'s really not a big deal. If he enjoys it, then that is ultimately what matters.However, I am giving this product 4 out of 5 stars because of this discrepancy as well as the fact that the French horn (while also sounding off) sounds really, really weak compared to the other instruments on the cube. The other instruments seem very clear and concise and yet, I can barely hear the French horn.But, my son seems to enjoy it so far (and as I mentioned, he doesn\'t seem to care much for toys yet) and to me, that is worth the money in the end.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"The music is pleasant, though sometimes gets stuck on the same piece over and over. 7-mo-old likes to hit the squares, but the same song just starts over again with each strike. The toy just isn\'t as versatile as I\'d imagined. Quite limited. Sound quality is rather harsh, also.",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My 1-year-old grandson really loves this.  He is already very fond of music and this allows him to change the sound using all the different combinations available on the cube and he is listening to Mozart while doing so....doesn\'t get much better than that.  It\'s very easy for a young child to manipulate and there are no small parts to worry about.  I highly recommend this.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Great toy! My daughter loves it! It is incredible to me that it does so much for so small a price.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Has 8 recognizable tunes and easy enough for our 9 month old to figure out. Nice silicone-esque edging makes it easy to grip and keeps from sliding.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My one year old son enjoys music. He was thrilled to play with this. Pushing the buttons to hear all the different sounds. Plus my 3 year old likes to play with the cube also. It gives them a chance to play together.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is bright, sturdy and has great music.  It\'s a nice concept - conducting your own symphony, so to speak.  It has not maintained my one year old daughter\'s attention for very long, but that may be because it was a Christmas present and there are other things that she is more interested in right now.  I love the rubber balls on the corners and the bright colors.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My grandson loves to fall asleep while listening to either religious or classical  music.  When I was shopping on Amazon.com for Christmas presents, I ran across this Mozart Magic Cube.  I liked the colors, listened to the songs and read the posted reviews.  The price was acceptable so I purchased it.When my daughter opened the present for him, he immediately picked it up and smiled.  He must have liked the colors.  Then I turned the music on for him and received an even bigger smile!  It now stays in his crib with him, so he can fall asleep to his favorite tunes.Thank you, Amazon, for carrying this product!  Debby Pate",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I use this item when I\'m working with students (preschoolers), especially those who are multi disabled.  I have to assist them to push individual interments but I really like the music (sound).",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son received this toy when he was about 3 months old, although he didn\'t become interest in it until he was about 8 months old.  Now (he\'s 18 months old) he carries it around with him from room to room wherever I am to play the symphony for me.  He loves to push those buttons!  This toy plays about 7 different songs, and my son has certain ones he just loves and dance to.  The whole orchestra can play or you can push buttons on and off during the song to have only the piano or french horn play together or by themselves.  It\'s great, I wish it took bigger batteries so I wouldn\'t have to replace them so often.  There is a volum control but it only has two settings.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 18 month old son loves his cube.  He experiments with the different instruments and tunes.  Anything with buttons and lights is a hit, so adding music is just icing on the cake.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,It\'s neat but my 18 month old son doesn\'t like it much. He actually sometimes complains about it and wants me to just turn it off.,2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,something different  nice,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,best baby toy there is 6 month old loves it she loves to grab it and wakes up singing because of it,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"After reading several reviews of this toy, I purchased it for my 5 month old son.  He spends a couple hours, everyday scooting around in his walker.  The Magic Cube is a fixture on the tray of his scooter.  While investigating all the rooms he will touch instruments on the Cube and make it play.  As always, when the Cube falls off of his walker he stops in his tracks and cries until either my wife or I pick it back up and put it on his tray again; then he\'s off to the next wonder of the house.  It will be interesting to see how he evolves with the interaction of this toy.  I\'m glad I made this purchase.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Received a item that seems to be used for a long time.Its outward condition was bad as if it were used for a long time.if it\'s the new one, because of its improper package seems it to be old and used.I don\'t recommend this to anyone now.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is a must for any baby. My son is 1 year old and loves all the different music and instruments. It\'s also easy for your little one to push the big buttons.  The only thing I don\'t like about this product is that there is no volume control.  Other than that it\'s a good solid toy.,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter LOVES this toy.We first gave it to her at 6 months for Christmas, which was too early. She wasn\'t strong enough to push the button herself, so she didn\'t really like it. Around 8 months or so, she started liking it. The more she figures out how it works, the more the likes it. At 11 months, she plays with it all the time. Now she\'s strong enough to lift it, so she hands it to us to play.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Totally love it--it was for a gift, but I couldn\'t stop using it myself!  The song keeps playing while you add or subtract instruments--what a great way to show children the different instrumental sounds!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"All of the great reviews of this product encouraged me to purchase it and I\'m so glad I did!  This will be a birthday present for my daughter (who, by the way, won\'t have her 1st birthday until November), but I wanted to make sure that we have educational toys for her, and this truly is very musically educational.  A great toy to incorporate the elements of instrumental music.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"As the father of a four-month old daughter, and someone who has studied music from the age of 4, I was thrilled to play with this toy, and spent over 30 minutes playing with it myself. The sound quality isn\'t great -- it\'s true (think midi instruments from your standard cheap composition software), but the idea is fantastic. There are numerous songs, each with harp, piano, flute, french horn, and violin parts. You can listen to any combination of those parts on any song. Although it\'s a bit much for a four-month old, I\'m sure she\'ll enjoy it as much (or more!) than I do.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is a very versatile toy- it\'s small and simple enough for an infant to play with. Then as the child ages and becomes more aware of different noises he/she can experiment with combining various musical instruments.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I BOUGHT THIS TOY FOR MY THEN 1 YEAR DAUGHTER WHOS NOW 18 MONTHS BECAUSE SHE SAW IT IN A STORE AND REFUSED TO LET IT GO BECAUSE OF THE MUSIC I AM GLAD I BOUGHT IT 20 BUCKS WELL SPENT ONCE OUT OF THE STORE SHE HAS NOT PARTED FROM IT SINCE UNTIL SHE DROPPED IT FROM HER HIGH CHAIR AND WE THOUGHT IT BROKE BUT I REMOVED THE BATTERIES CLEANED IT WITH ALCOHOL AND ITS BRAND NEW AND SHE COULDN\'T BE HAPPIER THIS TOY IS AMAZING AND SHE LOVES HEARING THE SONG IN DIFFERENT WAYS ESPECIALLY THE ORCHESTRA ITS LIKE HER SECURITY BLANKET JUS A TOY INSTEAD. THIS TOY IS VERY MUCH RECOMMENDED I WILL BE BUYING THE SING ALONG I JUST BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE FOR MY 8 MONTH OLD NEPHEW AND HE LOVES IT,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,my kids love this music cube.  they love it so much that I started to get this product for my friends\' children or babies.  the music and the lights keep them entertained.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My just turned year old grandson, Eli, received this from us for his birthday and immediately started playing with it.  It\'s one of his favorite toys!  I highly recommend its play value.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,The Mozart magic cube is an AWESOME toy for my busy little 15 month old boy.  It\'s one of the VERY few toys he will stop and play with.  He has always loved music from a young age.  He like to hit the various buttons and it is small enough for him to carry around.  It also can take lots of abuse.  My 4 year old daughter will play with it as well.  Really a classic must have for babies and toddlers.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 4-5 month old baby loves this toy.  It is very easy to press the buttons and activate the sounds, so even very young, uncoordinated babies can get this toy to make noise.  As she gets older, she can use the cube to learn about different kinds of sounds and about colors.  For now, though, she just likes to chew on the corners and is delighted whenever the music starts playing.I am giving this four stars instead of five because the cube is secured to its packaging with wire-like pieces of plastic that protrude from the toy.  It is actually very difficult (and maybe impossible) to remove these pieces entirely from the toy, and that presents a danger of poked eyes and scratches.  Eventually, we had to cut the plastic ties very close to the toy and then push the raw ends into the toy, where they still are (and we hope they stay there).  There seems to be no way to remove them entirely.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My son got this for his first birthday and he hasn\'t stopped playing with it.  He loves the music and has started dancing to all the songs.  If the cube is out of reach he will even point at it and start dancing.  It was so easy for him to figure out.  He carries it around room to room so that it always nearby for music.  He has thrown it several times and it was not damaged. I am going to start buying this toy as a gift for other babies and toddlers because I am positive they would enjoy it also.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought the Mozart Magic Cube 3 years ago for our grandkids\' toybox at our home. This past summer, one of the little ones left this outside - of course it rained. When we found it the next day we thought the cube was finished as it was completely silent (I have no idea why I didn\'t throw it out). After a few months it surprised us and started making music again. It still looks and works like new - even after spending a night in the rain and after 3 years of abuse from a large contingent of young grandchildren. The kids - from the babies to 8 years - continue to enjoy playing with it.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I\'m grandma and I purchased the Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube for my grandbaby. It is precious. The bright colors light up and the music is beautiful. I love the way my grandbaby can choose various instruments to play the melody.I give this toy 5 stars. It was worth purchasing.Enjoy!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,this was just as advertised.  Perfect forlittle fingers.  Quite nice toy withlovely sound quality and bright colorsand flashing lights.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 11 month old grandson loved this toy -- dances to it with smiles all over.  His big brother (9) wants to play with it too, having a greater understanding of the instruments.  Their dad, 39, liked the option of adding or subtracting instruments from the mix.  Good tunes, good fun.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a great transitional toy. We\'ve had it since my son was tiny - as an infant, he liked to look at the lights and colors. At 18 months, he dances to the music and loves pressing the buttons. I don\'t think he fully gets the concept of adding and removing instruments to the orchestra yet, so once he figures that out, we\'ll have many more months of fun with the music cube. The music is pleasant - my only complaint is that it only has one volume setting.One word of caution, if you have a climber - this toy makes a great stepping stool for toddlers who like to climb out of their cribs. :)We love the music cube - highly recommend it!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My son loves this toy and so do I :) it lights up to the tune of each song. great toy!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Like it very much,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My daugther loves this. She sits there dancing to the music.  I also love it...I just wish I could adjust the volume sometimes.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"The fabulous Munhkin Mozart Magic Cube was given to our friend\'s daughter when she was an infant. From a very early age, we watched in amazement as she responded to the sounds of the music, obviously recognizing changes. We could see the pleasure on her face. As time went on, she played with the toy herself and was constantly drawn to it.There was always a limited assortment of toys for her to explore on the living room floor. She loved to play with some more than others. However, she was always constantly drawn back to this -- the sounds of the music from different instruments was a great source of fascination.As she gets older, the way that she handles Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube becomes more selective and sophisticated. This is one of the best toys we have ever seen to develop delight in music!She is beginning to talk now, and I feel certain that her first words will be, ""GET ME A HARPSICHORD NOW!!""Love it!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son (now 19 months) got this one last Christmas, and a year later it is still going strong.  Not only does he still enjoy it, mom & dad still enjoy it.  That is, it\'s music is pleasant enough that it doesn\'t give us a headache -- can\'t say that about a lot of these electronic toys.  Quite a deal for $15.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our daughter got this toy for her first birthday.  It was an instant hit not only with her but with her dad and grandfather!  Great music selection, brilliant interaction (being able to add instruments to the song is an awesome feature), extremely durable (our daughter immediately stood on it, which didn\'t affect it in the least).  Only downside is the sound quality, which even for a kid\'s toy is pretty awful.  All of the sounds are really tinny and scratchy.  The piano and harp are decent reproductions, but the violin, french horn and clarinet are all shoddy electronic noises that bear little resemblance to the actual instruments.  Overall, though, it\'s a great toy.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter got this for her first birthday today and she loves it!!  I know the newness will probably wear out eventually, but for now, it\'s probably her favorite thing from her birthday.  My 2 year old also loves it!  And I love it because the music is fairly pretty (for a kid\'s toy).  It\'s not annoying and not too loud either.  Great toy!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My one year old son has played with this toy since he was 6 months old and it still entertains him.  While the instruments do sound a bit synthetic, the toy still provides an introduction to different instruments and how multiple instruments can create a complex music piece.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My husband and I gave this toy to our son for his 1st birthday.  What a GREAT toy.  He loves it, and so does his 4-year old brother.  They play with it every day, many times a day.  The music is a nice change from the usual nursery rhymes, and we haven\'t grown tired of listening to it.  A really terrific toy!!!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My son loves to dance to music now. He received this for his 1st birthday and it was an instant hit. He quickly learn how to work it and he still loves to play with it at 20 months old.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this product as I was looking for some alternative toys for my 7.5 mo son, so he cld play/hear music when he wakes up in the morning in crib, instead of trying to stand up all the times.I love the product after reading reviews, love the rounded corner, love the design that baby has to play all by HIMSELF!  My boy totally enjoyed it for the first couple days and could sat and played for 20 to 30 min, it totally amazed me.  Until one day I found him, after playing the cube for 15 min, covering his ears and trying to escape.  I turned the cube off and he\'s happy again, then I realized the cube could TOO loud/noisy for infant.Different from most of other musical toys that have volume options, this one does NOT and its volume was definitely on the higher side, which might not be too good for infant, especially when it was designed for &#34;all ages&#34; - 0 month +.Anyhow, I\'m still using it to buy myself a little bit time in the morning, but I don\'t let him to play for more than 5 min, that would be my temporary solution for now.",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a wonderful product. It will keep the baby interested and won\'t annoy you with horrible singing and songs like many of the other baby toys that light up and play music. In fact, it\'s Mozart, so it\'s actually pleasant and enjoyable. Will listening to Mozart or the individual instruments\' parts make your baby smarter? Of course not, but it will be enjoyed by all.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This was holiday gift mailed to small granchild.  Our first Munchkin cube, now broken, was a popular toy w several local grandkids  It no longer holds interest since the on/off button ceased working. We have been unable to make permanent fix. When working, the cube is brightly lit, colorful, instruments are depicted on faces of cube, & when pressed, play solos. The &#34;orchestra&#34; face, when pressed, plays all instruments together as &#34;orchestra&#34;. It is a nicer toy & decently priced.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Just received this toy for my daughter\'s first birthday. She loves it. It keeps her attention, which is quite hard to do. It has beautiful music and its neat how the different instruments can be turned on and off without skipping a note in the music.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our 8 month old loves to &#34;bang&#34; things so this is perfect. He moves it around, bangs on it and lights it up with music. Great buy!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Not the best toy. We bought this for our 1 year old and while this is a great IDEA for a musical toy, it could be SO much better. The biggest problem is the instrument sounds. None of them are great, but some are really awful. The worst is the violin sound - it sounds nasal, fake, and is terribly grating. It may be ok for the child, but for the parents, remember that you have to hear these over and over every time the kid pushes a button. I have no idea why Munchkin didn\'t just use real instrument recordings. Sounds like they chose the first MIDI instruments they found and called it a day.Also, this may just be our son, but he isn\'t that into the toy. Funny story though...We were at the store today looking for a shower gift for another baby and our son found a similar toy by Baby Einstein - same idea with instruments you can turn on and off. He loved it. We had to take it away from him so we could go, he was having so much fun with it. The sounds were less grating as well on that one. It looks like a turtle, if you\'re interested.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,We were given this toy as a gift for my first son. It has survived three small children and needed only its batteries changed. It is fascinating for young ones and will delight them with its changing lights and music. As a gift or for your own child you can not go wrong.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Like it very much, also very suitable for me, will come again next time, have a preferential activities to inform me.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,She LOVES this toy.  Keeps her attention totally.  It was one of the first things she went for Christmas morning.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Several years ago we purchased a Mozart Magic Cube for a grandchild. After that child and 3 additional siblings played with it, it finally gave up. Child # 6 is a year old and another baby is on the way, we bought the same toy for this family. It was Cha Cha\'s Favorite toy, along with a small giraffe. She took the two gifts, and went across the room and played with them while all the other children continued to open their packages. Can\'t recommend this toy enough. It plays Classical songs in the voices of different instruments and is obviously well constructed.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I often search for toys with great ratings on Amazon.  This one is another great buy.  My 7 month old daughter loves playing with it.  She plays with this simple cube more that most every other toy.  I would definitely recommend this for the 6-12 month age range.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My son really liked this toy. I was a really great teething toy for him to bite on also it has many other things to keep in interested,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Super cool toy that my baby absolutely loves but within a week the batteries need replacing, and he\'s not playing it every day... Sadly now he\'s not playing it at all, out of batteries!",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I may like this toy more than my daughter. My favorite thing is to do a bit of orchestration by adding and subtracting the various instruments. I do find the tone of the piano mildly discordant and usually remove it from all of the tunes.As for baby, this toy is great for putting an end to the occasional crying jag. She presses the buttons easily. I don\'t think she\'s got it all figured out yet, but it\'s one of her favorite toys. We also love the soft rounded corners on this toy.  I\'ve seen my daughter giving them a nibble now and then.The cube is durable. My baby often pulls it off the shelf to send it thudding to the floor and it still works.It is a bit big and rather heavy for a child to carry.  However, my only real complaint is the packaging. When I received the cube, it was fastened in with plastic coated wires that ran through holes in the cube. I cut them with scissors at first only to have them stuck in the cube. I finally wrapped the remainder around a letter opener and pulled it free. The cube comes with no instructions on removing these wires.Quick mention: You\'ll need a screwdriver to install the batteries.5 stars. Great toy. Neat concept. I think my daughter will grow to love this toy more over time.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,the music is very lovely.i also love this music box and my daughter is also.you can hear the 8 song. the mozart.and you can play a 5 music instrument.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter received this for her first birthday.  She absolutely loves it.  She\'s 16 months old now, and it has become her favorite toy.  She will climb into her toy box, over all her other stuff, to get to it.  It keeps her busy for a good 20 minutes at a time while she experiments with all the different songs and musical instrument sounds.  We still haven\'t had to replace the batteries, which is a definite plus!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We got this as a free gift for my twins\' first birthday at a secondhand store. They loved it instantly and have enjoyed it ever since. Now it is our 6 month old baby\'s favorite toy. The baby likes to push the buttons and the girls dance to the music, so it\'s been a great toy that they can all use together.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I wish I could give this cube 5 stars! If it were based on how much our twins adored the toy, I would definitely give it a better rating! However, I feel the need to mention that we initially purchased this toy for our 6+ mos old twins and within a few months the battery cover cracked right next to the on/off switch, leaving the batteries easily accessible. Duct tape would not even keep the cover on securely, because the cover was under so much pressure from the batteries and springs underneath.When our twins were 1 1/2 we decided to put it on the Christmas wish list, because they both adored the first one so much. Much to our dismay, the exact same thing happened to the battery cover of the second one!What a huge disappointment! Obviously this toy has a manufacturing defect and I can only hope that Munchkin fixes it for future production of the toy. The concept is excellent and our twins really did love it, especially our very musical little girl.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Fine toy, nice sound.  Much better than most other musical toys.  But I can\'t give it to my son yet as I can\'t seem to get these damned wires from the packaging out of the toy.  They are threaded through these tiny holes in the product and I haven\'t yet gone out to get pliers as someone else suggested.  You shouldn\'t need pliers to free a toy from its packaging.  Obviously the manufacturer didn\'t receive the memo that we are pushing for frustration free packaging. I even took out the screws that access the battery pack (which I am quite impressed with as well), hoping to access where the wires are stuck.  No luck.  If they just used regular string, it would easily come out, but these plastic coated wires are too stiff to pull through in the manner that they have put them.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We were given this product for a gift - from our wishlist - for our, at the time, 12 month old daughter. She loved it, and carried it around everywhere. One day, she dropped it. She was 29 inches tall. It was in her hands and fell no more than 15 inches. It broke. Saddened, we contacted the CS department to see about getting it fixed. We were told too bad - it fell.So, basically, a toy made for young children can\'t fall any distance, and was not under a warranty because of the fall and would not be fixed. Therefore, I will never buy anything from this unrealistic company again. If you make kid\'s toys, you might want to make them kid durable.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son is now just over a year and has had this toy for about 6 months. I bought this because he loved the baby einstein take along tunes toy and thought this would be similar type music and activity. The sound is horrible! Every instrument sound is extremely screechy. I am not sure if I just have a bad product, but I feel like I wasted my money on this.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this cube for my son when he was about 6 months old.  He\'s now 18 months.  He loved the toy then and still plays with it now.  Even though his absolute favorite activity these days is pushing toys around on the floor and climbing on furniture, he still will sit and play with his cube.  It\'s the only toy from his infancy that he still enjoys.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Bought this a year ago for my 18 month old. I also had a 3 year old at the time. They have played with it off and on. Enough to run the batteries down once a year later. We have a new baby and now he\'s messing with it some. Not a huge hit.,3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our son 5 month old son loves things that light up and play music, which is why we bought this for him. He likes to look at it, but hasn\'t figured out how to push the buttons on his own yet. The buttons are sensitive, so they will be easy for him to push once he figures it out. Overall, this is a pretty cool toy.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a very well made and creative learning toy/tool. It plays a variety of tunes very well. A lot more pleasing to the ear than most of the noise makes around. The genius however, is that you can add or remove the five instruments while they are playing. Make your own combo, quintet, quartet, trio, duet, or solo, in any combination. That should keep your rug rat busy for a while, it did me.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter got both the Mozart Magic Cube and the Sing-a-long Cube for Christmas this year, and we love them both!  I am a music teacher, and I think these are just really cool musical toys for young children.  The sound is much better than I expected, and my daughter loves them both.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is one of my favorite infant gifts! It plays wonderful classical pieces. The sides are easy for infants to activate. Each side flashes as that instrument plays to keep their attention. Good for infant to age 5 at least!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We bought this for our son when he was six months old.  He\'s now 18 months old, and he still enjoys playing with it, but it drives me crazy when he plays more than 2 of the instruments at one time.  There is an intonation problem among the instruments that is unbearable to anyone who has experience in music.  True, the baby loves the lights and he loves having control over the music and what\'s playing, but I almost have to leave the room when he gets too many ""musicians"" going at once.This is fun toy, but don\'t buy it if you can recognize bad pitch.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son LOVES this toy.  He will be playing with other toys, walk over to the cube turn on some music and then go back to his toys. He will do this almost all day long.  He loves playing with it as well.  We bought it when he was 1 year old and he has been playing with it ever since (16 mos now).  And another good point is that the sound quality of the music is good enough for a parent\'s ears as well.  Buy this toy.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"After looking for a musical toy that was not annoying, off-key or obnoxious, we discovered this.  Plays several songs by Mozart; baby can play a song with all instruments at once by pressing ""orchestra"" or one at a time.  Baby can also turn off instruments one at a time. The instruments are clearly synthesized, but still, the quality is not bad and I could listen to it for long periods of time.  I have yet to be annoyed by this toy.  In fact, I may have to buy two - my twins fight over it constantly!  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it\'s a little bit loud.  I wish there was a volume control.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is another favorite toy of my grandson\'s.  I hope that he picks up an appreciation for the wonderful music it provides.  It is a safe toy with no sharp edges and is easy for Brian to play with.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Munchkin Mozart Magic CubeThe older version of this toy had much better songs and in addition to that it\'s so hard to enjoy playing with this because it\'s painfully loud.  Ridiculously loud.,2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son loves this thing.  He has sat and listened to songs repeatedly, turning various instruments on and off to hear the effect.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This cube is large and heavy so young babies cannot hold it, nor totally grasp the concept...which means that it will not be a toy they will be able to (or even want to) play with independently.  In addition,  the manufacturer\'s recommended age (6 mos -boy are they trying to pull one over on parents) is extremely too young.  I also think this toy is priced too high.  We\'ve bought large activity tables for less than the cost of this cube that entertain my son longer. If given the choice,  I would not purchase it again unless I found it used and/or substantially cheaper.  Recommended age: 1 yr. and up. Recommended purchase price: $14.99 or less.",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this but my little one is definitely not old enough yet to grasp the concept...but she is getting there and lives to play with it, and so do I! Not annoying but very good tones. Love it, bought one for my nephew and cousin too!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Great toy in theory, but way too loud!  I bought it and as soon as I realized that there\'s no way to control the sound I decided to return it.  Would be a great toy if added volume control to it!",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Worked great for about a month, then it broke and no longer plays music. Not for toddlers who like to throw things.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My 6 month old is captivated by this toy. He loves to hear the music and it\'s easy enough for him to press the various sides. The music and the lights hold his attention. This actually belonged to his now 5 year old sister and it\'s held up well in the five years we\'ve owned. I highly recommend it.,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"The musical sounds don\'t sound like the real instruments, they just sound like a cheap toy. Also, I thought each instrument would play its own melody, how it would in a real orchestra. For example, the horn would play the background, the flute a lighter melody, then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed. But really, each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument.  I was really disappointed, and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center. The ones on that toy are really neat.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Bought this for a 6-month old pseudo-niece as a Christmas gift. In the two or so hours she had the gift she seemed completely engrossed in the toy and entertained. She had no issue comprehending what to do with it and was playing within a minute of first touching the toy.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I found this item to be very disappointing. For one thing it\'s much too large and heavy for a baby to pick up and handle, although it may just be that my baby is too young for this toy at 7 months. The real issue I have with this toy is that the sounds it makes are just horrible. Off key, electrical sounding ""music"" is layered together to create a loud, jumbled, unpleasant sound that makes me want tear my hair out. This is not the learning toy I expected, coming from a family of musicians I\'m going to say that this toy offers absolutely nothing for a child\'s musical development. If you want your child to have a love and understanding of music, listen to classical, jazz or other complex music with them. If you want a toy that will benefit your child musically, give them a xylophone to play with. It\'s simple and fun, and will always produce a perfect tone.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a great toy, and the only toy my 8 month old son played with on Christmas morning (other than boxes and paper).  There is no volume, but I do not find it too loud.  It is very durable, and I find the quality to be very high.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Just enough stimulation -- lights, colors and music.  And the music is actually pleasant as opposed to so many of the baby toys we have!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a wonderful toy.  I bought it for my son when he was a young toddler (probably sometime in 2008).  He liked it, but wasn\'t in love with it.  My second child is now 13 months, and she LOVES this toy.  She always pushes the buttons and dances to the music.  I host a playgroup for children between 7 months and 3 years, and this is a wonderful toy to have out for all to enjoy.  The babies tend to play with it more, but the toddlers like to come over to see what they are doing.  I bought this in November as a baby shower present as well.  Both times, I purchased the product on sale (I think for around sixteen dollars).  For that price, it is definitely worth it.  I\'d also like to note that I have only had to change the batteries once in the 2 years I have owned this.  It definitely sounds awful when the batteries are dying.  Overall, a wonderful toy for babies and young toddlers!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son has played with this toy nonstop.  He is now 16 months old and it is one of the first things he reaches for when he wakes up.  When we travel I have make sure its packed.  Some kids have blankets, mine has the music cube.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Purchaed as a gift for family member.  They tell me the baby loves to play with it, and loves too lok at the flashing lights.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter received this as a baby gift when she was a newborn.  It was her favorite toy all through infancy and toddlerhood.  We even took it on a 15-hr international flight to keep her happy!  Even though it\'s a baby toy, both my children still enjoy listening to the music at ages 3 and 5.  This toy is WELL worth it!  It\'s a little tricky changing batteries, but you\'ll probably only need to change them once every 6-12 months.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This music cube is the best baby toy I have ever seen.  And it was by far our baby\'s favorite toy.1.  Good Music and Educational.  What\'s more educational than good music for a baby?  The six sides include five instruments (flute, french horn, harp, piano, & violin) and the orchestra which plays all five together.  What I love is that the instruments can be played separately, or together depending on which ones you touch.  You can start one, and then when you press the second it joins the first.2.  Portable and Safe.  We loved the smallish size and took the cube with us on planes, car rides, and into restaurants.  No sharp edges, no metal.  Each corner is covered in a firm rubber (which is also good for chewing on...).  Not heavy so if it falls on your little one, no tears.  Although light weight, the cube is sturdy and firm enough for your little one to use as a base to lean on.  Our baby used the cube not only to lean on, but also to help her stand up.3.  Easy to Use, Good for parents.  The cube is one piece, no complicated set-up, and takes just two easy-to-find AA batteries.  There is also an on/off switch which is useful when traveling to prevent the music from playing continually in your luggage bag.  The music is NOT annoying, nor particually loud.  And if you want to stop or change the tune, just touch the side that is playing at that time and it will immediately stop.Fun for your baby, educational, good for parents-- I highly recommend this toy for any parent with a baby.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a totally cool product...for the parents.  By the time the small child this is designed for could possibly appreciate what the toy teaches, he/she would be at least 5-10 years old and by then, the toy still requires patience.  This is just a good idea that can\'t quite reach the audience it hopes too.  I still like the toy, but sadly, it\'s just not for babies. (And I\'m a musician with a broad mind for what my little one can understand---this is just too advanced.)Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son really enjoyed the Mozart cube,  but it didn\'t last very long. It stopped working after less than 2 weeks of use.  I changed the batteries, but it still didn\'t work. It is just too pricey for the amount of time that it lasted.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My twins loved this toy when they were infants,  they\'d stare at the flashing lights and listen to the music.  Now they are 13 months old, and my son in particular loves to turn the various sides off and on listening to how the music changes.Often, if I need to distract him from something I can start the cube playing and he\'ll go right over to it and start to play with it.There\'s the added benefit that the music is pleasant for adults as well.  We don\'t get tired of hearing it play over and over again, and it has several different Mozart pieces that it plays.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,our son loves anything that plays music and when we heard about this toy we went out and bought it.  He was 15 months old then and didn\'t seem to like it.  He pushed the buttons afew times but mainly it just sat. I bring it out every couple of weeks to show him how neat it is and it still does nothing for him.  He is now 21 months old.  He loves the leap frog drum and the phonics radio.  ANd they were only 19.99 each not 34.99.I wouldn\'t spend your money on this.,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,i work with multiple disabled children and they love this toy. I bought this one for my 6 month old niece and has the most fun trying to figure her colors.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"sound is good, the way the music evolves with diff instruments if you push them is nice, but is waaayy toooo heavy for baby to carry and to push!!",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Great idea, and fun for the baby, but so loud that I have actually wondered whether it is safe for my child\'s hearing. I can hear this toy all the way upstairs, in a totally different part of the house if it is playing in the living room. I have heard it TWO floors up at my parents\' house. It is WAY too loud, and unfortunately there\'s no way to turn it down.",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is the best purchase I have made thus far for my new grandchild.  She has loved it from the very beginning and her interaction with it as she grows is ever changing and stimulating. She has gone from just looking and listening to it, to pressing the buttons herself and chewing on the ends as a teether and has begun to select the music and instruments on her own. It is an incredibly well designed item and very sturdy as well.This is an excellent choice for a baby gift.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,We received this toy as a gift for our baby. Haven\'t used it yet but we had the same trouble with the packaging as everyone else! Pliers work.,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This music cube is a great idea, but unfortunately the sound quality is terrible. The violin doesn\'t sound at all like a violin. Overall it\'s very tinny and hard to listen to.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I was a little skeptical at first.  But this cube is a lot of fun! There are instruments on each side that can be turned on and off while contributing to the main song.  You can have a piano solo, and then add other instruments on top.  Well built cube, should last a long time!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I knew this thing wouldnt sound very good, I can accept that. Most all of these kind of toys sound like crap. What gets me is the violin is badly out of tune with the other insturments. Many a sour note. My son holds his ears when it plays all the insturments together. Otherwise its another piece of plastic that makes noise and passes the time. What do you expect for 20 bucks? Want to get your child into music? Get them a harmonica. My son plays all the time and passes on the cube.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,my 1 year old son loves turning on and off this music on this toy! its a great product for babies who love music!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My baby daughter got this as a gift. I thought it sounded terrible and it scared her. I might have hung onto it to see if she would grow into it, if it weren\'t so loud. It\'s so loud, I was worried it would damage her hearing while she was holding it close enough to play with it. I returned it, and bought her aLamaze Mortimer the Moose, which she loves. It makes nice jingling, crinkling, and squeaking sounds.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a baby present we have given to all members of our family when their first child was born. I learned about it when it was first given to one of our grandchildren by a family friend. Our grandson listened to it when he was an infant, turned on the musical components as he learned how to press the sides, and then stood up and conducted music when he grew to toddler age. The children to whom we have given this toy also love it and their parents have been delighted with it.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Bought for my niece.  I blew plenty of time playing with it when it came in even though it was in the box still.  Can\'t wait till she opens it so I can get back to playing with it.Will update after I see how she likes it.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This toy is great! 1 year old Son got it as a gift and really enjoys it. He likes to throw things and has not done any damage to it yet. It has rubber corners so for now my floors are ok too. You can press a side of the cube and it will add a new instrament to the mix without restarting the music. I hate when toys start something new the second your child touches it. This one dosn\'t stop until the song is done unless you touch each instrament playing a 2nd time to turn it off. Love Love LoveOnly down side is the flute and violin sound a lot like eachother.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I purchased this for my special needs grandson who is 4. He loves toys that light up and make sound. It is difficult to find ones that he can easily operate and manipulate with his limited abilities. This fits his needs perfectly.The quality is very good, and I got a good price on it. Product is durable, so when he drops it from his wheelchair, it\'s not a big deal. I would highly recommend this toy for small children and older special needs children.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Yep, we\'re on our third grandchild, second Mozart cube.  This is the best toy in the world.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter got this for Christmas when she was about 6 mos old.  She rarely ever plays with it.  She was slightly amused with this toy for a month or two.  She never plays with it now.  When she did show interest in it, it only lasted a few moments.  The music does get a little annoying because my daughter liked it when all instruments would play at the same time.  Nothing special about this toy and it\'s loud.  Would not recommend.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,got this for my granddaughter --enjoyed by the whole family !!! --the sound quality could be richer and fuller --great teaching toy none the less Griffiths,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our seven-month-old twins love this. They are still too young to understand the functionality of adding and subtracting instruments, but they are fascinated by the sounds and babble happily along with them. Plus, the tunes are actual Mozart melodies and considerably less annoying for adults than the bleeps of many other ""musical"" toys. If anyone at Munchkin is reading this review, we would love a Bach Cube for variety!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My niece is musically gifted at the age of 1, and I think she will love this toy.  It is bright, colorful, and the instrument sounds are similar to the actual instrument the block depicts.  It will be fun for a one year old to press the colorful block buttons to hear the sounds they make.  If you are looking for a true-tone musical toy, keep looking.  It is exactly what I expected from reading other reviews about theMunchkin Mozart Magic Cube",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Our grand child loves playing with this musical cube. It is very relaxing. All Music is food for the soul...,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My wife and I have been living with these 8 tunes for the last 4 months with our 7 mos. old.  He was attracted to the noise and lights from the outset, and it remains his favorite light and noise toy to this day.  He can manipulate it easily, and is fascinated by his control over the sound.The toy itself is very well designed.  The panels take just the right pressure to activate, the chip does an excellent job of determining whether a press is designed to turn a panel on, off, or was just an errant double-tap from a youngster with less than 100% control over his appendages.  The rounded rubber corners are safe, flash enticingly, and apparently taste delightful.There are only 2 reasons I give this 4 stars rather than 5.  The first is that moisture can seep around the panels and destroy the contacts inside, keeping the panel from operating.  We\'ve lost one panel so far to well-aimed spit-up.  Babies and wetness go hand-in-hand, after all.  The second is that while the eight songs are well-chosen, it would be nice if manufacturers started designing these toys with the ability to either purchase or download additional tunes to update the cube.  For nearly 50 dollars, either a tune-stick slot or a flash USB port would be a very welcome relief to parents who have heard the french horn solo to twinkle, twinkle little star for an hour straight.**Six month update***The cube is still going strong, except for the one panel I mentioned as having failed earlier.  Although we use rechargeable batteries it is still nice that it really sips battery power.  The set of included alkalines went nearly 6 months before needing to be replaced.The cube is still a favorite toy, and has grown with our son.  Now it is baby\'s first boom-box -- he drags it with him to other toys, gives it a casual slap to get it started, and enjoys the music while he plays with his blocks or toy cars.  When he really focuses on it, he enjoys making it change sounds by activating or deactivating the various panels.  He has the sing-along version as well, and he will fire them both up and frown at the cacophony; much like a 3-foot orchestra conductor.The bottom line is that this toy has been a winner from day one, and continues to be a winner.  For its price, it is a fantastic value, and for the fun it brings our baby, it is priceless.  If I could, I would update our star rating to 5.  My earlier comments are still valid, but it\'s really the maestro\'s toy, and it\'s pretty clear how he feels about it: 5 stars all the way.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We absolutely LOVE this cube! I bought it for my 5m nephew...and although he can\'t quite sit up on his own yet, it is still an entertainer for him. Anytime we want to distract him, we start up the magic cube! The sounds are good (not annoying) and becos you can add and subtract any ""instrument"", it is not boring. I do wish the lights were brighter and more visual, but this is becod the cube itself is so colorful. Great product!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I thought this toy was really cute and it was definitely a hit with the child that I gave it too. However I bought two of the products and was extremely disappointed that only one actually worked properly.  Before you send something the people should make sure the product is actually working properly.,3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our first son received this toy for his first B-Day from his Great-Grand Parents.  He played with it almost daily, and now three years later his younger brother plays with it.  It\'s not annoying like many toys can be as the music is soft and relaxing. LOVE IT! Would for sure buy again if needed.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This seems like a great toy for the musically inclined baby, my 5 month old likes looking at the flashing lights and trying to eat it the music doesn\'t seem too loud to me or out of tune,  perhaps that is a defect for the previous reviewer?  My son seems to love looking at it and pushing the buttons, I think once he is a bit older he might appreciate it more.  However I do agree it is a great book shelf toy too.  IT looks fantastic!",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This toy was given to my son last christmas by my aunt. He loves this toy for all the different music it plays.  This is his favorite toy with the different sounds and lights...,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Our babies enjoy this music cube. They didn\'t take long to start pounding on it.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,He loved it.  Hopefully when he is a little older he\'ll listen to each part completely instead of going to the next button!!!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My kids (5 and 16 months) both adore this toy and it keeps their attention for a long time. It\'s also extremely durable, much to my chagrin. Unfortunately it has no volume control and it\'s so obnoxiously loud that I have to leave the room when they play with it. I also wish it had better sound quality - I\'d prefer them to hear real music with real instruments. I plan on smuggling it out of the house when they\'re not looking.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"great idea for a musical toy. i just wish the individual instrument sounds were a little more realistic. i might be a bit of a snob because i am a music teacher--but it seems like they could have done a better job with the sounds. still, the idea for the toy is great and i believe my son will really enjoy it as he gets a little bit older.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is my &#34;go to&#34; baby gift.  Of all the musical toys, this one sounds best! I love the chance to listen to individual instruments and then to hear them all play together.  Our Grands all love this toy!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a great toy in concept, especially for classical music lovers. My infant received it for his first birthday and his older brother, now 7 y.o, enjoys it as well. Pressing the buttons on the side of the cube allows them to assemble (instrument) parts of the song and even create their own little orchestra. The cube plays a number of recognizable tunes and the sound quality is good.However, the toys that arrived in our house were all damaged before they arrived. The outer layer is a very fine strip of plastic and the first two or three (I don\'t remember how many) that arrived were cracked and ready to splinter.Thin, sharp pieces of plastic or plastic splinters not good for babies, right?Amazon was quick to ship replacements, even without getting the original back, but I ended up returned at least two, maybe three. Think it was three. Sent two in one box together. Shipping paid by Amazon of course, but this was intended as my child\'s birthday present. It was ordered about two or three wks before his first birthday and he got the final undamaged toy about a month AFTER his birthday. Big points Amazon.The packing on this particular item was HORRIBLE! One air bag in an oversized box so this thing got banged all over tarnation. Big points again Amazon.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My little one year old son loves to pick his own instruments/music. A music lover myself, I feel this toy was an introduction to my toddler\'s love for music. He now knows different keys, strings etc. cause different sounds. Great for \'cause and effect\' learning as well!!",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Our baby loves music so we knew this would be a great choice.  We were right!  She dances and sings to the rhythms.,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter had this toy for 6 years before it finally stopped working.  She loved it when she was a baby/toddler and would still play with it as she got older.  It took a lot of abuse and still worked great!  I babysit in my home, so it went through dozens of children rolling it around and pounding on the buttons and throwing it across the room.  I enjoyed the music and it was a great way to show kids how each instrument sounds by itself and then all together.  The kids loved starting with the flute and adding each instrument until they were all playing and then pushing the buttons until it was back to one.  Overall a great toy that will last for years!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I have a disabled daughter that is 27. Even though this item is geared for babies. My daughter is able to benefit from the cause and effect of the age appropriate music.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 15-month-old loves this music box.  It\'s durable, too, which means Mom loves it too.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is an entertaining toy. The sound is of good quality and not too loud. Although it is not a music studio sound quality - it is far better than the usual kind of sound found in most toys. It is not annoying too for adults. It is also of good size- not too small. The edges are made of some kind of rubber material that does not easily slip or protects the toy when falling.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I love this Magic Cube.  It was a gift from a friend, and is a fantastic toy.  The musical selection is good, the quality of the tones is also quite good.  It is the first interactive toy my four month old baby figured out how to use, though he tends to hit the sides with his feet rather than his hands.  You won\'t regret this one!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"When I received Munchikin Mozart Magic Cube, I was very disappointed because it looked so cheap and its tone was not beautiful at all. But my 23-month old baby son immediately fell in love with this toy.  I\'m happy to see him playing with this many hours a day  giggling and chuckling.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this when my baby was less than a year old. He loved it. While it is not the highest quality music, this is a toy that was meant for children and they seem to really enjoy using it. It is easy for their uncoordinated hands to use and interesting enough that they continue to explore it. It has bright lights and different musical instruments to select from or to blend together.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This was a good gift for my nephew\'s birthday.  He played with it for a while despite all the distractions of a birthday party!  I cannot comment on durability.  Battery installation requires a screwdriver, the cover is good for keeping those tiny fingers out.The sound from the unit was fine and it functioned as described.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,No kidding. My 18 month old baby loves this music cube !!! It is one of the few toys that my kid has payed attention to. I like it a lot myself. I strongly recommend this toy,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter has been playing with this toy for a year and a half, and loves it still.  It is the least annoying musical toy we own.  The music is pretty, the quality of the sound is quite good, and you can listen to it for 2 years without wanting to pull your hair out.  She has long since understood the difference in musical instruments and can recognize the individual sounds of instruments in the music we hear throughout the day.  ""Listen Mommy, a french horn!""",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,The coolest thing about this cube is that you can push the different sides to have that specific instrument play in the song. It\'s great for your kids learning to hear different songs. It also lights up and plays very nice classic type melodies vs the standard children\'s songs.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I purchased this for my one year old niece. It was great while it lasted -- for one day. The music was loud, clear. The toy is easy to use and fun to play with. The colors are great and quite attractive to toddlers.However! it broke after ONE day of playing. My niece simply dropped it from her height, which is at most one feet! After she dropped it, a strong plastic burning smell started to come from the cube. I immediately unscrewed the panel that covers the batteries, and removed the batteries.Now whenever I move the cube, I can hear something loose inside. This toy should not be of such poor quality if made for kids of ""all ages"" who could do all sorts of unimaginable things to it!Great toy, but TERRIBLE quality. I recommend spending your money on alternatives if you can find one.UPDATE: After opening up the cube, it is obvious that the speaker module was never securely placed into its socket, and because of this it has severed a ribbon cable. Because of this manufacturing problem, when the cube is moved or rolled around, the speaker module pulls on the surrounding ribbon cables repeatedly which eventually breaks the solder joint that connects the wire to the circuit boards. The short circuit, which causes the melting plastic (and the fire hazard) is a result of the exposed power and ground connections making contact with the severed ribbon cable. The cube now functions correctly. However I will be keeping a close eye on it.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My one year old son loves it. It is well constructed. No sharp edges. Safe for babies. Very easy to clean. Battery is still going strong after 6 months.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I bought this magic cube about 2-3 months ago and at that time my baby wasn\'t really able to play with it. But now he\'s 6 months and he plays with the cube longer and longer. This is one of my baby\'s favorite toys now!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We love this toy. I bought it for my 5th month old for christmas, and now he\'s 9 months and he still loves it. The best part is... it\'s not annoying at all! Score for mom :-). It lights up and has a rubbery grip to it so i don\'t haver to worry about him bitting the sides of it when his teeth are bothering him. Very happy we bought this item.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Shows different musical instruments so baby can experience either each instrument on its own or combined with others. However munchkin did a bad job with packaging using wires to secure box to package. Wires are attached to internal part of cube and not possible to remove. Had to cut, could not pull out so had to push remnant wire into cube. One wire got stuck and may poke my child. Think will throw the cube away as it is a safety hazard.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 22-month-old twins luuuuuuuuuvvv this little Mozart cube (one of them in particular -- he tries to take it everywhere he goes!). Unfortunately there is no button to lower the sound, as there is on many musical toys, but it is Mozart, so it isn\'t grating to adult ears. This is a terrific toy and I\'m sure it\'s good for my little guys to be listening to world-class music. However, the toy itself is not very durable, in my opinion. We\'ve only had it three weeks, and already the sound has stopped playing (though the lights still light up). My little nephew has one of these cubes as well, and his mom pointed out that although his still works, the plastic cover has cracked, causing them to wrap it in plastic tape so that it would not fall apart. I am buying a second one for my boys because they adore it -- but if this one dies too, that\'s it. No more cubes at twenty bucks a pop.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,i gave this to my ten month old daughter as a gift and she loves it! i think she enjoys the different musical responses she get as she touches a different side of the cube. this is very colorful and seems durable as well...wonderful...very pleased,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our toddler has what we call a &#34;jukebox&#34; tendency- he sort of uses any musical toys as background music while doing other activities. Most musical toys became quickly grating to our ears so we invested in this highly rated toy. Well, he LOVES it and the sound quality of this toy is good enough where you as an adult can appreciate the Mozart melodies. He plays with this several times a day, every day so as far as we\'re concerned it was a great investment.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"my 8 month old love this toy! ..... the music is wonderful .... and sounds great! best to put the cube on the floor for your baby to sit up and play. this is great gift for any reason..... the only thing i would want to see improvement in. is to make the volume adjustable, which it\'s only on one level loud ..... i don\'t mind it...... my husband tends to yell back at it .... and i sit and laugh !!!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Batteries ran out of power right away. When it was opened for Christmas the Harp light didn\'t work.Compared to the older version, I didn\'t think the songs were as good. Have been about ready to send it back.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We bought this for our granddaughter before she was a year old.  She just batted at the cube to make music.  She is now two and a half; she has progressed from random punching of the different sides (""directing"" the orchestra as she went), to adding and subtracting instruments and changing the song. She\'s danced to it, sung with it, and dropped it several times.  We have never had to change the battery, not has it ever slipped up in its performance.  This is the greatest toy she owns; learning to love Mozart is a wonderful bonus for this piano-teacher grandma.  Now I\'m buying one for my newest nephew.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I realized that my son was stimulated visually so I decided to buy this toy for him. I was so amazed how quickly he responded to it especially when I turned off the lights. If your child is very observant, this is definitely the toy to get.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this for my 8 month old son. From 8 months to 18 months, this was by far his favorite toy. He would spend hours playing with it and was one of the few toys he didn\'t get bored of. He would press the buttons, hug the cube and yes, occaisonally he would throw it down the steps, because it makes noise when bouncing from step to step. When he finally managed to destroy the first one I quickly purchased a second to replace it.One of the best toy purchase I have made for him. The music is not the greatest and does have a tinny ring to it. This is not something that I would listen to or enjoy, but then again the toy is for my son and not for me. If you need concert quality sound then an iPod stuck to 4 Bose speakers may be the way to go for you. If you want a toy which keeps your kid happy, this toy will be hard to beat.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,We love this toy!  We bought this for our daughter when she was 15 months old.  She is now 19 months old and we still play with it every day.  The music is not too loud or annoying like most children\'s musical toys.  Adults love to play with it too!,5

"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","I am so disappointed.  I have a standard toilet seat and this potty seat does not sit snuggly on it, and does not even come close to fitting my elongated one upstairs.  Plus it has no rubber grip material as many do on the bottom to keep it in place once my little one sits down.  As a result he slips every time.  I suggest bypassing this one and making sure you find one that is either adjustable or comes with some secure grips underneath.  Many potty seats are non returnable -- unless you can test it on your toilet first, don\'t risk this one!",2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",It is cute and my kids love it. I don\'t love it as much because it does not have the pee guard. That is part of why I bought it. My kids have a problem with peeing on the floor and this does nothing to stop that. If you don\'t need a pee stopper this will be a fine toilet seat.,3
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","it is not safe.  i would give it NO stars if i could.  this seat will not stay put on any toilet seat, there is nothing to wedge it into place.  as soon as your child tries to sit back on it, the potty seat pushes back out from under their bottom leaving the child unsupported.  the point is supposed to be to give your child independence, not make them dependent on you holding their seat in place. and i never imagined the ease in which the urine would get between the padded seat and the hard plastic bottom...it happened the first time.  poor kid, this was his reward for going potty so well.  we are going back to the FISHER PRICE TURTLE SEAT.  it adjusts to clamp into the seat so it won\'t budge and it is all one piece so there is no place for urine to get trapped..",1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","bought this as a replacement for my son\'s first potty seat, this one is much better. not as padded, which means it won\'t rip open and harbor a bunch of bacteria. my son\'s old one used to collect urine underneat of it in the plastic part, this one doesn\'t at all, it\'s perfect",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",I bought this seat for my 3 year old son because he loves Spiderman. This seat is awful for boys because the area of plastic prevents the pee from going into the potty. Instead it splashes every where else. I would not recommend this seat at all for a boy.,1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","We have an elongated toilet and I don\'t know of anyway to hold this seat in place. My daughter has trouble sitting back far enough because when she tries to scoot back, the whole seat goes with her. So when she pees, it gets in between the potty ring and the toilet seat and makes a big mess.",1

"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My son wanted a Thomas potty and this was a good choice for him. He loves the trains on the seat. However, the hole is not big enough. We have a difficult time getting my son positioned on the potty so that he can go without getting urine on the seat. And the cusion is not easy to keep clean because urine gets trapped underneath it and in the sides.",3
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",My son loves spongebob so naturally I had to get this for his potty seat. The pee shield isn\'t attached. Doesn\'t come with handles attached (which I noticed it said that later) and it wobbles on the toilet. Needless to say I went out and bought another seat and this one is in the closet,2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","We have 3 of these (1st was a gift; subsequent others purchased from Amazon after successful use). It is comfy padding (I presume comfy - the padding is quite thick and has some squish to it). The handles are great for keeping my daughter\'s hands busy instead of touching other things. While it does slide around on some larger toilets, I\'d say it fits well to about 75% of toilets we\'ve used it on.",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",I bought this from the wish list of a homeless shelter where I live. They have a number of children living there and I imagine many of them potty train while they are staying there. I know how much my nieces and nephews love Dora so I thought this would get used more than a plain potty seat.,4
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","I uploaded some pics of the size of toilet it fits, this potty seat is so good ,my daughter loves Dora so I got this for her.Take a look at the pictures I uploaded ,thanks for reading ,I hope I helped someone with the pics.",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",Affordable. However the soft patted Dora seat falls off.  It does not click in to were you can carry without the patted coming off.,4
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My daughter never wanted to go potty, was scared of the big toilet, but as soon as she saw her Spongebob seat she hopped right on and loved using it. Made potty training her a BREEZE. She switched straight over to the big potty and never looked back.",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My three year old son started training a year ago, on a stand alone potty.The thing was good for when he was little, and a potty novice, but now its more trouble than its worth. We purchased this seat when he was 2 1/2 (SpongeBob, he LOVES Spongebob!)PROS- Its not overly expensive- Comfortable to sit on for any ellapsed amount of time- Has SpongeBob on it, this could be a disstraction, but it makes my son want to go more!- Easy for a toddler to remove his/herself, and trust me this is a BIG deal to them! (with a stand alone they want to dump the contents, which never fails to leave a mess!)- The splash gaurd is rather flimsy, so I attached a piece of velcro to the side that would touch the potty, and another to the part of the potty where the guard attaches. It is still removable, but not flimsy. Its also high enough to catch everything- Its lightweight, easy for me or my son to carry.- Easy to store, right on the side of the potty, and also easy for him to put on himself!- Fits my oddly shaped toilet seats well.CONS- The seat is cushy and comfortable, but ours recently tore, and the rips hurt and annoy him, so I am now purchasing another from Amazon as I cannot find the SpongeBob one in stores.- Its hard to find, I could only find Elmo (he LOVES elmo, but he thinks SpongeBob is a big boy show, and Elmos a baby show, he wants to be a big boy on the potty)- The vinyl sticks to his bottom, and sometimes he wont get off because hes afraid of the sting when he gets up.All in all I wish we would have used the SpongeBob seat from the start! Its so easy to use, and simple (eww, stand alones are kinda gross) and I defiantly plan to keep this seat around for my 5 month old son, but purchasing another one, with another charecter will be possible. I reccomend everyone to use this potty, kids love em\', and you wont miss the mess!",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","I won\'t recommend this seat because it moves around too much no matter what kind of toilet seat you it put on.  Other seat that I purchased comes with non-skid/slide things that come with the seat that keeps the seat in place when your child sits on it, but this one has nothing to hold the seat in place and moves around way too much.",2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",this potty seat was just as described. nice colors. seems to be well made. any backyardigans fanatic will love this. a great potty training tool. very pleased.  J. Early,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",my son loves it! it is very easy to use. my son loves spongebob so it makes him want to go potty.  :),5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","We bought this because my son loves Elmo.  Unfortunately, he now refuses to sit on it because it slips around on our elongated toilet seat. It is completely unstable.  He won\'t admit it, but he\'s afraid of it.  So, now he won\'t go on the big potty and is back to his Baby Bjorn potty chair.  I\'m going to buy something else.",2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",My daughter is almost 2 and didn\'t really take to a traditional potty chair. She loves Dora so this seat seems to be working like a charm!,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My son is almost 2.5 years old, and has been potty training for about a month.  We have two potty seats---one for upstairs, one for downstairs.  This one is decent--we have no problems with it fitting on our elongated toilet.However, be prepared to clean up pee if you use this with a boy!  He has to sit just right in order to aim down and not get pee on the seat--I don\'t think the pee guard is high enough for use with boys.  Also--if he \'aims\' just right, pee gets under the seat, causing a mess on the regular toilet seat.  I have to clean both seats every time I take this one off for adult use.  It\'s easier for him to use it when he isn\'t wearing anything below the waist--he\'s better able to get his legs spread further apart for better support and aim.I think this would be better for girls--but someone has to get it right for boys!",3
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","The seat was very visually appealing and motivated him to potty, until he discovered that the vinyl seat stuck to his thighs and ripped skin off when he got up.  The result was red sore thighs for a good 12 hours and his complete fear of pottys.  If the big potty topic comes up, he wimpers and complains the big potty hurts and bit him. Back to the bjorn I guess.",2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","It arrived today. On the package, there was a sticker saying ""This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm."". I am returning it today without even opening the product.",1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","Really, how hard can it be to design one of these things? This fails for two basic reasons:1) It slides backwards on the toilet seat making it unstable and hard for my daughters to sit down. This is an enormous design flaw.2) The pee guard is basically flush with the seat, so what is its purpose other than to decrease the actual potty-business real estate? It takes away room for daughters\' pee to go down. And it\'s not high enough to save my baby boy from getting soaked when my daughter didn\'t clamp her knees shut tightly enough to prevent her pee from shooting cleanly over the guard and onto baby\'s head. He was not pleased. Neither was I.I also have a two mini-potties, the Fisher Price froggy and singing ducky. The pee guard on the froggy potty is great. I love this low-tech seat as it\'s easy to clean and hands down my twin daughters\' favorite. The singing duck potty was more expensive, is much harder to clean, is annoyingly loud and wakes up the baby, and there are a lot more spills due to the lack of pee guard. Highly recommend the froggy potty if you are in the market.",1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",The Dora potty seat goes with us everywhere when we go out. My daughter has recently potty trained but isn\'t ready to use the toilet yet so this seat is perfect. She also loves the pretty design :),5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",Another child to potty train and anything they are into to get them to go is where I head and this seems to do the trick. It holds up well and she seems to enjoy seeing Dora.,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","Really colorful and does its purpose but it does slide a bit in the toilet bowl. No biggie, since it gets the job done.",4
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My daughter who is 20 months old LOVES this seat...I bought the royal toddler potty but decided to buy this one as well b/c its good to travel with...she refuses to sit on the royal potty..she rather use this one on the toilet seat.  The only problem is we have an oversized toilet so its not a snug fit, but it does the job.",4
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","Don\'t get this kind. They have fun designs but they are hard to clean. There are crevices were poo and pee can get stuck. Another main problem is the plastic molding that holds the cushion. It\'s sticking up a little bit in the inside circle and when the cushion gets pressed the buttocks get dented. Whenever my 2 yr old sits on this potty seat her buttocks would get red and the plastic molding would leave a mark. She would complain that it hurts to sit there for a long time. :(  I just bought ""Mommy\'s Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat"" It\'s amazing. No boo boos. And easy to clean. :)",1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","I had bought this cause I thought its cute. well its cute but it doesn\'t function well. My 2 1/2 year old son slides all over the place, its not secure at all. When he pees he pees over and the pee goes even in between the seat so i have to flush everything and clean the toilet. the cup holder is a joke.. it really holds nothing, so i cannot recommend this for boys at all. I am about to get another potty seat, something that will hold his pee and will fit safely in my toilet.",1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","We have a daughter who is 3 1/2 and a son who is 21 months. We bought this seat for our son because the one we already had didn\'t have a splash guard and we thought our son would need one as he first started using the potty. I miss the handles we had on the other potty ring. When you need to take this ring off (for big people to use the potty), you have to grab the ring instead of just grabbing the handles. It seems dirty. Also, so far, my son is having no parts of this splash guard. He never saw his sister use one and he doesn\'t want to use the splash guard either. I don\'t blame him. There doesn\'t seem to be enough room to sit behind the guard without bumping into it. He loves the Diego pictures and our other potty ring for upstairs is the Backyardigans, which he also loves. He just doesn\'t want to use the guards, and I\'d prefer handles.",3
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My two year old had regressed to not wanting to use the potty. So I got this because she LOVES spongebob. Worked like a charm, now I hear all day I poop on Bob lol. If your kid likes Spongebob and you have having potty training issues, I can\'t promise anything but it cleared it right up for me :)",4
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","very hard seat, doesn\'t stay put inside toilet seat and isn\'t comfortable for the little ones.  My child refuses to use it and reminds me often that she doesn\'t like it.",1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","Wonderful lightweight potty chair.  It even fits my oblong toilet seat.  Very encouraging for my son who is obsessed with ""Bob-bob"".",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","This fits perfectly in the toilet. It\'s also cute, considering what it\'s used for. My son is a little too young for potty training still, but he likes to sit on it and look at spongebob.",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",Purchased this for my Grandson to use at my house. Works very well and he really liked the Spiderman all over the potty. He used it and all is working well - I also bought the step stool (Thomas the Train logo on step stool).,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",love ti - has a front little cover so he doesnt pee anywhere but in the toilet - love the handles - perfect,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","Bought this for my 2 year old daughter when she started showing interest in using the potty. I echo other\'s complaints that it is not good for elongated toilet seats & slides back when my daughter tries to sit down. However, my daughter\'s biggest complaint is that it is uncomfortable and cuts into the backs of her legs. The pee guard is not removable so if she sits on the potty with her pants around her ankles the pee guard cuts into her legs. If she sits on the potty seat without pants on (and thus can spread her legs wider) the padding compresses and the plastic ring of the potty cuts into her legs.The Elmo print is cute and my daughter loves Elmo but the design flaws have left me in search of a new seat that she likes more.",2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",Although my son was excited about this seat it does not function well.  My son is 2.5 and it\'s too small.  When he pees it ends up shooting over the seat rather than into the toilet.  If it were larger it would be much better.,2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",My grandson love the Ginsey Diego Soft Potty Seat.It`s wondeful for him.It`s very practical and soft for kids.,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","this product is wonderful, especially for little boys. My son went through 3 potty seats/toliets before we got this one. the lip on the front is great for little boys. we found a lot of potty seats/toliets are not ment for little boys. but this one is perfect.",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",I have the Diego and the Disney cars seat for my twin boys and would not recommend the diego toilet seat for boys as the cover that makes sure the penis goes into the toilet is not big enough cover. I like the cushion and handles though. I would rather recommend the Disney car toilet seat with a larger potty cover for peepee.,2
"Color your tub Fizzy Tints, Ages 3 and Up","We have a hard time getting my son to take a bath, due to the fact that he realizes that bath=bedtime.  But these tablets make bathtime fun, and when we ask him what color he wants his bath to be, he runs into the bathroom and is all ready to jump in!  These tablets dissolve in the water (even watching the dissolving is mesmerizing to him!) and change the color of the bath water.  I think they even make a submarine and other toys that you can put the tablets in and watch the colors move around the bath.  You should not use these with younger children because they take a while to dissolve, and a younger child might pick them up and put it in their mouth because they look a little like candy.  My son is 2, and completely gets what it\'s for, and hasn\'t tried to eat it.  I highly recommend these for stubborn bathers!",5
Sassy 602 - Teething Wing Butterfly,My son started teething early (3 months) and he was not yet able to control his movements enough to chew on teething objects.  He was however able to grab things and this butterfly was so easy for him to pick up. The one wing is like a handle and it easy for him to move and light enough for him to get to his mouth.  As the days go by he is finally able to chew on it for a few seconds before he loses the control.  He is still unable or uninterested in doing this with any other teething toy.  Plus he somehow finds the butterfly entertaining.  A+ for a young teether.,5
Sassy 602 - Teething Wing Butterfly,This product is well thought out.  I can see where my grandson will be able to hold this without any problems.  The colors are vibrant also.,5
Gund Baby Tinkle Crinkle Rattle Toy,My daughter\'s nickname is \'Worm\' so this toy was just a natural purchase.  Little did I know that it was going to be one of her \'go to\' toys that she wants to take with her everywhere.  There is a mini one available on Amazon as well and it\'s just as cute.  I\'m not so sure what the Tinkle part stands for but the rest of the words in it\'s title name is accurate.,5
Gund Baby Tinkle Crinkle Rattle Toy,"I know the dimensions are listed, but for some reason I was surprised at how big/long the caterpillar is.  Because it is not like a big stuffed animal (long and thin) it was very easy for my 4 month old to hug and hold.  He can easily pull it to his mouth to bite on it.  He\'s almost 6 months now and can focus on one area or another...it is still big for him.  So I can see how for the next few months, he\'ll still be interested because it is big and he can do more and more with it.  my 2 year old niece visited and latched onto it and began imagination play.",5
Gund Baby Tinkle Crinkle Rattle Toy,"We initially got this toy for our daughter based on the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio rating.  I think it was too big for her at first, but now (she\'s eight months old) she loves it.  She rediscovered it a month or so ago and loves picking at the antennae as well as squeezing and shaking it to get the various sounds.  It\'s also nice because the sounds aren\'t obnoxious....",5
Gund Baby Tinkle Crinkle Rattle Toy,Got this for my nephew for Xmas and he\'s at the point where he\'s starting to grab and inspect things. Not to mention it\'s great for him to chew on while he\'s teething. I wish it lit up or did a little more but no real complaints. Great for infants!,4
Gund Baby Tinkle Crinkle Rattle Toy,My toddler certainly enjoys playing with  it.  Brightly colored and easy to clean. Great gift idea for toddlers. Recommend the smaller one as well.,4
Gund Baby Tinkle Crinkle Rattle Toy,We received this product and our little one really likes all the colors and the squeaking noise but I\'m not sure where the &#34;crinkle&#34; part comes from because our product must be defective.  There isn\'t any crinkle but we can live without.,4
Baby Drum Musical Toy,I ordered this for a gift.  My little nephew loves it!  His big brother also frequently wants a turn. It pretty good quality also.,4
Baby Drum Musical Toy,Got this about a month ago for my 7 month old son.  He takes his sticks and beats on this thing forever.  We LOVE it!,5
Baby Drum Musical Toy,"For my 8 month old grandson who likes to bang on thngs. Put the sticks away till hes older, they went right in the mouth.",5
Baby Drum Musical Toy,"It\'s basic, it\'s simple, it\'s a drum.  Well constructed and can handle being tossed across the room by it\'s rambunctious 1 yr old owner.  If your child likes to make noise and bang on things like glass doors, give him this drum.  We also had to teach our son not to walk and run while chewing on the end of the drumstick.  It almost became a favorite teething toy.",5
Baby Drum Musical Toy,My son is 8 months and we\'ve had this since he was Z months. My son loves this drum! He sits on the floor right beside it and wildly bangs either one or both drumsticks (included with drum) on its surface. Both sides of the drum are able to be used. The surface does get scratched pretty easily but it still sounds the same.,4
Baby Drum Musical Toy,"My 11 month old great-grandson loves this drum!  It took him awhile to learn to use the sticks instead of his hand, but now he bangs like a champ!  It is very well made and lightweight so he can lift it and move it around easily.  The colors are bright and attractive.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This gate was a replacement for the crappy Swing \'N Lock.  This gate is so easy to install.  The only problem was we have baseboards and couldn\'t use the template.  SO I simply measure 3 inches off the floor and then marked the holes to drill and folded the template to get the upper holes marked.  We did however have a lot of wall damage due to the fact that this was installed on the metal corner protectors under the drywall and a lot of the joint compound fell off due to disturbing it.  I will not fix it now since I\'m sure I\'ll have more to fix later.  I like this gate because it has two point of contact in the locked and closed position.  Both rails the upper and lower fit about 1 1/2 inch into a metal seat.  This makes it so secure.  I don\'t agree w/ the other reviewers that said the lower rail pops out, I\'m sure if it was installed WRONG.  Just make sure to measure properly and make sure things are even, level and line up and there is NO way the rail is going to pop out!  I did pinch myself a few times opening this the first few times.  You have to slide the rail in a bit to swing it and there\'s a metal piece on the top rail that supports the two gates, ouch.  Will remember not to do that!",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I just got 2 of these (top and bottom of the stairs) and think they are great. The most common complaint other reviewers have is that the bottom pops out. I think I know why:There are rectangular steel boxes for the top and the bottom latch ends of the gate. The box for the bottom is deeper than the one for the top. If you install the shallow box on the bottom and the deep box on the top, then the bottom of the gate will pop out easily. When the boxes are correct, the bottom is held securely.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,The gates(I bought three) are pretty and relatively easy to install.  My 20 month old is a climber and has scaled many gates; this one he can not because of the horizontal slats.  But it is easy for me to open with one hand and my older children to open with two hands.  I highly recommend this product.,5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This is the only gate I\'ve seen that is approved for stairs. It is really good for this purpose. It is sometimes awkward to install to a railing. Make sure not to install it too low, it\'ll catch the floor and is difficult to open. If you install it too high, the little ones can squeeze under.",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,Works well with banisters. The great thing about it is that you can remove it when you have guest over at night when the babies asleep.,4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This gate is great. We love the natural wood finish. I have had this gate for 6 years and it still looks like new! We used it to keep our Cocker Spaniel in the tiled part of the house while we were at work. Every time I use it, I think to myself how much I like it. It is very easy to open and shut. I like how it is securely bolted to the wall. However, if you don\'t want to put screws in your wall, this may not be the right one for you.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We\'ve had our gate for almost 5 years on the top of our stairs and it works beautifully. After installation my husband noticed that if pushed it would pop out on the bottom as our house is older and the walls are uneven.  He solved the problem easily by installing a small door stop on the other side of the gate bottom so the bottom of the gate slides between the metal bracket and the door stop.As others mentioned it is easy to remove (sans hardware) and reinstall.  My kids are 3 and 4 so we only need the gate at night.  Each morning I pop it off and store it away.  Even when it\'s on it doesn\'t look that bad, in fact I think it\'s one of the nicer gates I\'ve seen.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,We cannot say enough good things about this gate.  We bought this gate almost four years ago for the top of our stairs (we have an open stairway in our living room to the lower level.  It is a very strong gate and has held up very well to child torture!  We really like that the gate can go both directions.  I would highly recommend this gate.,5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This gate is awesome!  We have three of them and I (female) have installed them all myself with ease!  It probably took me 15 minutes the first time and 10 minutes with the additional two we bought.  And, the hardware is metal which is a huge plus!  We had purchased a very pricey gate that had plastic hardware, and after replacing it three times I gave up and purchased this one.  It comes with a template and it\'s simple to install - step by step instructions.  As long as you line the gate up correctly (which is explained in the instructions) it opens and closes quickly and easily for adults, however my three children, the oldest of which is almost six, can\'t figure it out!  And that\'s saying something because my three year old boy has figured out every contraption out there!  We love it and I recommend it to everyone!  Even when I\'m in the store shopping and see people looking at gates I recommend it to them.  Buy it!  You\'ll LOVE it!!",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"If you buy this gate, do not buy it online unless you can return it to a store (which you can do with Babies r Us). I have three of these gates, and the first one I tried to install was terrible. The gate has two slatted panels and in order to close the gate, you have to slide one panel and latch it. But the panels would not slide - they were so stiff I would have had to use my foot as well as my hand to close the gate! Obviously unacceptable. But I checked another of the gates and it was fine, and worked like a charm. I don\'t know if it\'s relevant or not, but the first gate was made in Mexico, and the second in China. Maybe there\'s a bad batch of Mexican-made gates out there, or maybe it was just a one-off. I don\'t know, but it may be something for you to be aware of if you purchase this gate.Also, I attached the gate to a relatively narrow doorway, so the two panels were mostly overlapping. So the gate is nice and sturdy, and I think it would be good even at the top of stairs, if the stairway is narrow. However, I DO NOT recommend this gate for use anywhere - especially the top of stairs - if you need to use it towards its widest range. The two panels are then stretched out and the gate becomes flimsy. It\'s my suspicion that those who have complained about the gate being flimsy and the bottom rail popping out have used the gate in a wider opening than those who think its a sturdy gate. So don\'t buy this gate if you need it for a wide opening.Finally, the third gate also slides well (made in China) but it will not fit where I wanted to put it. I suspect it is common to many gates that they work only in quite specific situations, and you can\'t really tell if it\'s going to work in your situation until you get it home and really take a good look at it. So, once again, do be sure you can return this (and probably any other) gate before buying.All in all, I recommend this gate - but ONLY IF you will be using it in a narrow opening. It is sturdy and not too difficult to install. It also looks reasonably nice if that matters to you.",3
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We bought ours at Lowes. We were so happy because it looks good, it\'s lightweight, and easy to open. However, after installing it on top of our stairs, I question my husband on how it swings... then all of sudden the spindle came off! The spindle was just glued on it! I was so shocked and returned it the next day. This should have been recalled.",1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I love this gate! I promise if you purchase this product it will not be a disappointment. It is easy to handle and convenient. I use it by my stairway. The great thing is that I have older children, ages 9 &amp; 5, they have no problem opening gate. There may be some cheaper gates you could purchase, but I think it is worth the extra money to know you will be happy.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"Just a tip - after searching the web, looking for the very best price for this gate (especially since we need four of them!), I called my local Target store to see if they carry them.  They do, & lo & behold, they charge $... for them (same as the best price on the web), except that you just have to pay tax, not shipping (which can be $... on line).  And, you can pick it up today, rather than waiting for them to ship it to you.Just thought someone would like to know.",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This gate is pretty good for indoor use.  I have a 21 month old that is into everything and she has not been able to get over or through this gate yet.  The gate does not hold up well in the weather, so for outdoor use like decks it\'s not very good.  The wood swells and the bottom portion does not go into the slot.  Would recommend for indoor use but not outdoor",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We\'ve been fighting with our pressure lock gate at the top of the stairs for about 2 years now. We finally decided to look for a replacement and this seemed like a good choice. Reading previous reviews gave us a good idea what we were getting into with installation. (Thanks everyone!) Armed with that knowledge, we were able to install the gate with little difficulty. The template is useless if you have molding, as predicted. To my mind, the wood doesn\'t seem as sturdy as I\'d have liked. We have the gate essentially to prevent accidental falls, and it\'s good enough for that. It is not hard to open or close. Anyone getting fingers pinched isn\'t paying enough attention to what they\'re doing, imo. I can\'t say if I\'d recommend it for a high traffic area, since that\'s not where ours is, and I don\'t know how it would stand up to normal toddler abuse. But as a safety net, this gate is a good choice.orig review date: 2007, updated July 2013-- this gate is still in place! No problems with it whatsoever. That\'s a good value!",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We bought this for the top of our stairs leading to the basement and it works great. I looked on Counsmer Reports.com and this was a best buy for a mounted gate. We tried it and love it, we know our little is now safe. It is also so easy to use because we frequently go down the stairs because we have a finished basement. Safe and eay to use, you can\'t beat that!",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"Overall this is a very good gate. It is made of wood, it is VERY sturdy and the 4-point hardware makes sure it will not be knocked down as pressure mounted gates. It does not have that bottom bar that some gates have, so there is no chance of tripping over that.The only negative thing is the opening mechanism. You have to unlatch it and slide the gate in and that is not as easy as it sounds. Sometimes you need to use both hands to use it. The positive side is that there is no way a kid would open that latch.",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This baby gate is AWESOME!!! It is so easy to install and its function is flawless. The fact that it both swings and slides makes it so versatile as to where it can be placed. It is so strong my 2 year old will climb up onto it and shake it violently and it has stood up to these conditions for over a year!!! This is a home run as far as baby gates go, it is great for both the top and bottom of stairs, too. A++.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"If you have a baby and stairs, this is the gate you want.  I have the gate installed at the top of my stairway and it works perfectly.  My son likes grab hold of the bars and &quot;shake&quot; the gate. The constructions holds extremely well, so he doesn\'t go tumbling down the stairs.  I love the fact it is easy for adults to open and close the gate.  The swing out option is plus also.  I would highly recommend this gate.",5
